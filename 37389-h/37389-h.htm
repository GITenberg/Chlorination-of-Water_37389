<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>No apology is necessary for the publication of a book
on the chlorination of water. This method of treatment,
practically unknown fifteen years ago, has advanced in
popularity during the last decade in a most remarkable
manner, and in 1918 over forty millions of people are being
supplied with chlorinated water.</p>

<p>It may justifiably be said that no other sanitary measure
has accomplished so much at so small a cost; and that
civilization owes a deep debt of gratitude to the pioneers
in municipal water chlorination: Dr. A. C. Houston in England,
and Mr. G. A. Johnson and Dr. Leal in America.</p>

<p>In this volume I have endeavoured to collect and correlate
the information hitherto scattered in various journals
and treatises and to present it in a comprehensible manner.
The various aspects and methods of chlorination are discussed
and suggestions have been made which, I hope,
will stimulate research work in this fertile field of science.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to the engineering
staff of the Ottawa Water Works Department and to
Lieut. W. M. Bryce for the preparation of diagrams.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">CHLORINATION OF WATER</h2>



<hr class="c05" />
<h2><a name="Ch1" id="Ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>HISTORICAL</h3>


<p><a name="Sec1_1" id="Sec1_1"></a>Chlorine, although one of the most widely distributed
elements known to chemists, is never found in the free condition
in nature; it exists in enormous quantities in combination
with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc.
As sodium chloride, common salt, it occurs in practically
inexhaustible quantities in sea water together with smaller
quantities of other chlorides. In mineral form, enormous
deposits of sodium chloride are found in Galicia, Transylvania,
Spain, in England (particularly in Cheshire), and in
sections of North America. The most important deposits
of potassium chloride are those at Stassfurt, Germany,
where it occurs either in the crystalline condition as sylvine
or combined with magnesium chloride as carnallite.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_2" id="Sec1_2"></a>Chlorine was discovered by the Swedish chemist Scheele
in 1774, but he, like Lavoisier and his pupil Berthollet, who
declared it an oxygenated muriatic acid, was unaware of
the elemental nature of the new substance. Sir Humphrey
Davy investigated this body in 1810 and definitely proved
it to be an element; Davy designated the element chlorine
from the Greek <i>&#967;&#955;&#969;&#961;&#972;&#962;</i> = green.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_3" id="Sec1_3"></a>The first attempt to utilise chlorine,
or its compounds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for bleaching purposes, appears to have been due to James
Watt, who noticed the decolourising properties of chlorine
during a visit to Berthollet. This attempt ended in failure
because of the destructive effect on the fibres, but, in later
trials, this was prevented by first absorbing the gas in a
solution of fixed alkali. These experiments proved the
possibility of bleaching by means of chlorine compounds
but the high cost of soda made the process unprofitable,
and it was not until Henry succeeded in preparing a combination
with lime that could be reduced to a dry powder
that this mode of chemical bleaching became a commercial
success.</p>

<p>The manufacture of chloride of lime (hypochlorite of
lime, bleaching powder, bleach) was taken up by Charles
Tennant in 1799 at St. Rollox near Glasgow, and in 1800
about 50 tons were sold at a price of $680 (&pound;139) per ton.</p>

<p>Chlorine is produced as a by-product in the manufacture
of soda by the Leblanc process, but until 1865, when the
British Alkali Act stopped the discharge of hydrochloric
acid vapours into the atmosphere, the development of the
bleaching powder industry was not rapid. The hydrochloric
acid that was formerly discharged into the air as a
waste product afterwards became a valuable asset that
enabled the Leblanc process to successfully compete with
the newer ammonia-soda process. In 1890 another competitor
to the Leblanc process was introduced when caustic
and chlorine were produced in Germany by electrolytic
methods. After the successful development of this method
in Germany, it was taken up in the United States of America
and in 1912 more than 30,000 electrical horse-power were
daily used in this industry. In 1914 the almost complete
cessation of exports of bleach from Europe raised the price,
which attained phenomenal heights in 1916 (cf. <a href="#Page_125">page
125</a>), and stimulated the production of bleach both in the
U. S. A. and Canada.</p>

<p>As a disinfectant, chlorine was first used about the year
1800 by de Morveau, in France, and by Cruikshank, in
England, who prepared the gas by heating a mixture of
hydrochloric acid and potassium bichromate or pyrolusite;
this is essentially the same as the original mixture used by
Scheele.</p>

<p>During the early part of the last century the efficacy
of chlorine of lime as a disinfectant, and particularly as a
deodourant, was well recognised and as early as 1854 an
English Royal Commission used this substance for deodourising
the sewage of London. A committee of the
American Public Health Association reported in 1885 that
chloride of lime was the best disinfectant available when
cost and efficiency were considered.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_4" id="Sec1_4"></a>Eau de Javelle, first made by Percy at the Javelle works
near Paris in 1792, is another chlorine compound that has
enjoyed a considerable reputation as a disinfectant and
deodouriser for over a century; it is essentially a mixture
of sodium chloride and sodium hypochlorite.</p>

<p>The discovery of electrolytic hypochlorites dates back
to 1859, when Watt found that chlorides of the fixed alkalies
and alkaline earths yielded hypochlorites on being submitted
to the action of an electrical current.</p>

<p>Until the middle of the last century disinfection was
regarded as a process that arrested or prevented putrefactive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
changes but the nature of these changes was imperfectly
comprehended and micro-organisms were not associated
with them.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_5" id="Sec1_5"></a>In 1839 Theodor Schwann,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_1" id="Fnanchor1_1"></a><a
href="#Fn1_1">[1]</a></span> who might be regarded as
the founder of the school of antiseptics, reported that &#8220;Fermentation
is arrested by any influence capable of killing
fungi, especially by heat, potassium arseniate, etc....&#8221;;
but his results were not accepted by the adherents of the
theory of spontaneous generation and it was not until the
publication of the work of Schroder and Dusch<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor1_2" id="Fnanchor1_2"></a><a href="#Fn1_2">[2]</a></span> that
Schwann&#8217;s views were even partially accepted. The final
refutation to the spontaneous generation theory was given
by the monumental researches of Pasteur who, in 1862,
proved the possibility of preparing sterile culture media
and demonstrated the manner in which they could be
protected from contamination. Bacteria and other micro-organisms
were shown to be responsible for the phenomena
that had been attributed previously to the &#8220;oxygen of the
air,&#8221; and from this period the development of bacteriology
as a science proceeded rapidly.</p>

<p>The next important step, from the public health standpoint,
was the discovery by Koch, in 1876, that a specific
bacterium (<i>B. anthracis</i>) was the cause of a specific disease
in cattle (anthrax or splenic fever). In 1882 Koch made
a further advance by developing a solid culture medium
which permitted disinfectants and antiseptics to be studied
quantitatively with a greater degree of accuracy than had
been possible previously.</p>

<p>Since 1845, when Semmelweiss succeeded in stamping
out puerperal fever in Vienna, where it had been so long
established as to be endemic, chlorine has been very generally
employed in sanitary work and the conditions necessary
for obtaining successful results have been partially elucidated.
Baxter was the first to state that the disinfecting
action depended more upon the nature of the pabulum than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
upon the specific organism present and this was confirmed
later by Kuhn, Bucholtz, and Haberkorn. The latter
found that urine consumed large quantities of chlorine
before any disinfection occurred.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_6" id="Sec1_6"></a>One of the earliest preparations used in sanitary work
was an electrolysed sea water, usually known as Hermite
Fluid. This was introduced by M. Hermite in 1889 and
was employed for domestic purposes and for flushing sewers
and latrines. It was used at Brest for the dissolution of
f&aelig;cal matter and a prolonged trial was given to it at
Worthing in 1894. The report of Dupr&eacute; and Klein, who
conducted the bacteriological examinations, was against the
process, but Ruffer and Roscoe reported more favourably
and further trials were carried out at Havre, l&#8217;Orient, and
Nice. The <i>Lancet</i> (May 26, 1894) reported at length upon
the Worthing experiments: it was found that during the
electrolysis of the sea water, the magnesium chloride was
also partially converted into hypochlorite, which then dissociated
into magnesium hydrate and hypochlorous acid;
the former deposited in the electrolyser and left the solution
acid and unstable; urine was found to act upon it at
once with a consequent loss in strength of over 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_7" id="Sec1_7"></a>Another electrolytic method was that of Webster,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor1_3" id="Fnanchor1_3"></a><a href="#Fn1_3">[3]</a></span> who
installed an experimental plant at Crossness, near London,
in 1889. A low-tension direct current was passed between
iron electrodes placed in the sewage and although the process
was largely one of chemical precipitation, Webster noted
the disinfecting value of the hypochlorite formed from the
chlorides normally present in the sewage. He also directed
the attention of sanitarians to the possibility of using sea
water as a cheap source of chlorides and a plant based on
this principle was erected in Bradford in 1890 and reported
upon by McLintock.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_4" id="Fnanchor1_4"></a><a href="#Fn1_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Sec1_8" id="Sec1_8"></a>Strong salt solutions were substituted for sea water by
Woolf and the product was commercially known as &#8220;Electrozone.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
A plant of this description was installed at
Brewster, N. Y., in 1893<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor1_5" id="Fnanchor1_5"></a><a href="#Fn1_5">[5]</a></span> for chlorinating the sewage from
a small group of houses. The sewage was discharged into
a small creek which polluted Croton Lake. Successful
results led to a similar treatment near Tonetta Creek.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor1_6" id="Fnanchor1_6"></a><a href="#Fn1_6">[6]</a></span>
This was apparently the first occasion on which the specific
object was the destruction of bacteria.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_9" id="Sec1_9"></a>Electrozone was used at Maidenhead, on the Thames,
in 1897 and the installation was reported upon by Robinson,
Kanthack, and Rideal in 1898. Kanthack found that
a dosage 3-3.6 p.p.m. reduced the organisms in a sewage
effluent to 10-50 per c.cm. whilst Rideal found that about
18 p.p.m. of chlorine produced a condition of sterility in
1 c.cm.</p>

<p>Chloride of lime had previously been used in the London
sewage as a deodourant by Dibden in 1884 but the
treatment was not successful and was abandoned in favour
of other oxidisers.</p>

<p>During the last decade of the twentieth century the use
of bleach for the disinfection of both sewage and water
received the attention of many well-known German sanitarians
and many important results were obtained.</p>

<p>In the earlier experiments made at Hamburg, Proskauer
and Elsner<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_7" id="Fnanchor1_7"></a><a
href="#Fn1_7">[7]</a></span> obtained satisfactory results with 3-4 p.p.m.
of chlorine on a clarified sewage with 10 minutes contact.
Dunbar and Zirn (<i>ibid.</i>) used crude sewage and found that
17 p.p.m. of available chlorine were required to remove
<i>B. typhosus</i> and cholera vibria with a contact period of two
hours. A striking feature of all the German work on chlorination
is the very high degree of purification aimed at:
quantities as large as one litre were tested for specific organisms
and in many of the experiments with sewage <i>B. coli</i>
was found to be absent from a considerable percentage of
the samples.</p>

<p>The importance of previously removing suspended matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
which could not be penetrated by the germicide, was
emphasised by Schwartz<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_8"
id="Fnanchor1_8"></a><a href="#Fn1_8">[8]</a></span> although it had been previously
noted by Schumacher.</p>

<p>At the Royal Testing Station in Berlin, numerous experiments
on sewage chlorination were made by Kranejuhl
and Kurpjuivut.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_9"
id="Fnanchor1_9"></a><a href="#Fn1_9">[9]</a></span> The results were judged by the <i>B. coli</i>
content, which was taken as an index of pathogenicity
because this typical intestinal bacillus was found to be more
frequent and less viable than the majority of the pathogenic
organisms.</p>

<p>Other important work on this subject was carried out,
in connection with the pollution of the Hooghly River, by a
Bengal Government Commission in 1904; and by the State
Board of Health of Ohio in co-operation with the Bureau
of Plant Industry of the United States Department of
Agriculture in 1907. The chlorination experiments of the
latter were reported by Kellerman, Pratt, and Kimberly.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_10"
id="Fnanchor1_10"></a><a href="#Fn1_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The most valuable contribution to the disinfection of
sewage was that of Phelps,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_11"
id="Fnanchor1_11"></a><a href="#Fn1_11">[11]</a></span> who critically examined the
work of previous experimenters and directed attention to
the unnecessary stringent standards adopted in European
practice. His work at Boston in 1906, at Red Bank, N. J.,
and at Baltimore in 1907, demonstrated in an indubitable
manner the economic possibilities of sewage chlorination.
The dosages necessary for crude sewage and filter effluents
were indicated and also the necessary contact periods.
This work marks the commencement of a new era in sanitary
science.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_10" id="Sec1_10"></a>The first occasion on which chlorine compounds were
first used for the disinfection of water cannot be definitely
ascertained. It has been stated to the author that bleach
was used for treating wells as early as 1850 but this treatment
was apparently made without definite knowledge of
the destruction of micro-organisms.</p>

<p>In 1897, Sims Woodhead employed bleach solutions for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the sterilisation of the distribution mains at Maidstone,
Kent, subsequent to an epidemic of typhoid fever.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_11" id="Sec1_11"></a>The credit for the first systematic use of chlorine in water
disinfection is due to A. C. Houston with whom McGowan
was associated in the work carried out at Lincoln in 1904-1905.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_12"
id="Fnanchor1_12"></a><a href="#Fn1_12">[12]</a></span>
The reservoirs, filters, and distribution system,
owing to flood conditions, became infected with typhoid
bacilli which caused a severe epidemic amongst the consumers.
The storage and purifications works were thoroughly
treated with a solution of &#8220;chloros&#8221; (sodium hypochlorite
containing approximately 10 per cent of available
chlorine) which was regulated to give an approximate dosage
of 1 part per million. The bacteriological results were
entirely satisfactory but many complaints were received
that the treatment had imparted a mawkish taste to the
water. This was attributed to the action of the alkaline
chloros on the organic impurities in the water. It was also
stated that the water injured plants, fish, and birds and
extracted abnormal amounts of tannin from tea but no
substantiating evidence was produced in support of these
complaints. Houston made a continuous physiological test
of the effect of the chlorinated water on small fish by suspending
a cage of gold fish in the filter effluent chamber
and also proved that the treatment had no appreciable
effect on the plumbo-solvency of the supply.</p>

<p>Nesfield, of the Indian Army Medical Service,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_13"
id="Fnanchor1_13"></a><a href="#Fn1_13">[13]</a></span> reported
in 1903 the results of numerous experiments on the destruction
of pathogenic organisms by chlorine compounds and
suggested their use in military work to prevent a recurrence
of the appalling loss of life from water-borne diseases
(especially enteric fever) such as took place during the
Boer War. Nesfield proposed to use about 100 p.p.m. of
available chlorine and to remove the excess after a contact
period of 10 minutes. This work is especially interesting
from the historical standpoint because it contains the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
suggestion of the possibilities of compressed chlorine gas
in steel cylinders.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_12" id="Sec1_12"></a>A few years later, electrolytic hypochlorite (oxychloride)
was used at Guildford by Rideal and various chlorine compounds
were tried on the water of the Seine and Vanne, in
France, and at Middlekerke and Ostend, in Belgium.
Experimental work on water chlorination was also reported
by Thresh and by Moor and Hewlett.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_14" id="Fnanchor1_14"></a><a href="#Fn1_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>During the nineties many experiments on water chlorination
were made by Traube, Sickenberger, Kauffman,
Berge, Bassenge, and others. Traube<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_15"
id="Fnanchor1_15"></a><a href="#Fn1_15">[15]</a></span> was able to completely
sterilise water rich in bacteria in 2 hours by the
addition of bleach equal to 1.06 p.p.m. of available chlorine.
At the end of the contact period about 90 per cent of the
added chlorine was unabsorbed and was destroyed by the
addition of sodium bisulphite. Bassenge<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_16"
id="Fnanchor1_16"></a><a href="#Fn1_16">[16]</a></span> followed up the
work of Traube and that of Sickenberger and Kauffman,
who had shown that it was possible to destroy cholera
vibrio in Nile water by means of sodium hypochlorite.
Bassenge used higher concentrations than Traube and found
it possible to destroy <i>B. typhosus</i> and <i>B. coli</i> in ten minutes
with 60-90 p.p.m. of available chlorine. The excess was
destroyed by adding calcium bisulphite. Lode<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_17"
id="Fnanchor1_17"></a><a href="#Fn1_17">[17]</a></span> experimented
with waters seeded with <i>B. coli</i>, <i>B. typhosus</i>, and
<i>B. tetani</i> and found, contrary to Traube, that 1-2 p.p.m.
of chlorine did not sterilise in two hours. <i>B. coli</i> was usually
destroyed by 4 p.p.m. of chlorine in ten minutes and even
better results were obtained with <i>B. typhosus</i> and cholera
vibrio: the former was destroyed in one hour by 1 p.p.m.
and in ten minutes by 2 p.p.m.; the latter organism required
1-2 p.p.m. with a twenty-minute contact period. Lode
noted that organic matter lowered the bactericidal activity
of chlorine and recommended the use of 30 p.p.m. of chlorine
to ensure rapid and complete sterilisation. Berge<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_18"
id="Fnanchor1_18"></a><a href="#Fn1_18">[18]</a></span> used
chlorine peroxide, generated by the action of hydrochloric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
acid on potassium chlorate, for the sterilisation of water
and this process was afterwards used at Ostend at a plant
having a capacity of about 1,300,000 gallons per day. The
dosage was equal to 0.53 p.p.m. of available chlorine and
coke filters were used to destroy the excess although they
were not found to be indispensable as the free chlorine
disappeared spontaneously. This process appears to have
been tried on the Brussels supply and also for the treatment
of a hospital supply at Petrograd.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_13" id="Sec1_13"></a>The object of German sanitarians seems to have been
to obtain practically instantaneous sterilisation of water
for the use of travellers and troops in the field. Until the
commencement of the European War they did not have a
high opinion of chlorination and generally regarded it as
inefficient. Schumberg<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_19"
id="Fnanchor1_19"></a><a href="#Fn1_19">[19]</a></span> expressed the opinion that no
chemical method of disinfection could be absolutely relied
upon, under all circumstances, to prove fatal to bacteria.
Plucker<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_20"
id="Fnanchor1_20"></a><a href="#Fn1_20">[20]</a></span> stated that several investigators, particularly
Schuder, had shown that chlorine, even in the proportion of
40 p.p.m. did not invariably destroy cholera vibrio and <i>B.
typhosus</i>; and that with smaller doses the destruction
was still less complete. He also stated that the bacteriological
experiments of American workers were open to
criticism and that they employed antiquated methods.</p>

<p>By 1916 the German sanitarians appeared to have realised
that their bacteriological standards were too stringent
(Langer<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_21"
id="Fnanchor1_21"></a><a href="#Fn1_21">[21]</a></span>) and that the process had proved its value in an
indisputable manner.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_14" id="Sec1_14"></a>European practice, in the comparatively few instances
in which it has been used, has been to employ large doses
of chlorine and to remove the excess by chemicals or by
filtration through special media. In 1916, however, London
commenced to chlorinate a portion of its supply and the
following year practically the whole supply was chlorinated.
A dosage of approximately 0.5 p.p.m. is used and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the bleach solution is added to the pre-filtered water. Worcester
is also proposing to chlorinate the supply to maintain
the purity of the water without extending the slow sand
filtration plant.</p>

<p><a name="Sec1_15" id="Sec1_15"></a>In North America, hypochlorite of soda and chlorine
were used on the Jewell Filter at the Louisville Experimental
Station in about 1896 by George W. Fuller and a year later
they were used at Adrian by Jewell. The first commercial
successful attempt was made by G. A. Johnson. In 1908
the Union Stock Yards Company of Chicago were proceeded
against by the City of Chicago regarding the condition of the
effluent of the Bubbly Creek filter plant. Copper sulphate
had been previously used in conjunction with the filters
but stock shippers complained that the water had a deleterious
effect upon the animals consuming it. Johnson eliminated
the copper treatment and substituted bleach which
was added seven and a half hours previous to filtration, with
a dosage of 1.5 p.p.m. The results were very satisfactory.</p>

<p>About the same time, Johnson and Leal commenced the
treatment of the Boonton supply of Jersey City, N. J.,
consumed about 40 million gallons per day. The water was
first treated with 36 pounds of bleach per million gallons
(1.4 p.p.m. of available chlorine) but this quantity was
gradually reduced until only 5 pounds per million gallons
(0.2 p.p.m. of chlorine) were being used in April, 1909.
The ability of the process to adequately purify water became
the cause of a lawsuit and the decision of the Court
was:</p>

<p>&#8220;From the proofs taken before me, of the constant observation
of the effect of this device, I am of the opinion and
find that it is an effective process which destroys in the water
the germs, the presence of which is deemed to indicate
danger, including the pathogenic germs, so that the water
after this treatment attains a purity much beyond that
attained in water supplies of other municipalities. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
reduction and practical elimination of such germs from the
water was shown to be substantially continuous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the proofs before me, I find that the solution
described leaves no deleterious substances in the water.
It does produce a slight increase in the hardness but the
increase is so slight as in my judgment to be negligible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do therefore find and report that this device is capable
of rendering the water delivered in Jersey City pure and
wholesome, for the purposes for which it is intended and is
effective in removing from the water those dangerous germs
which were deemed by the decree to possibly exist therein
at certain times.&#8221;<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor1_22" id="Fnanchor1_22"></a><a href="#Fn1_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next few years the use of hypochlorite in
water purification, both alone and in conjunction with
filtration, became very popular and in 1911 over 800 million
gallons per day were treated in this manner. Amongst the
users were some of the largest cities in North America,
including Brooklyn, Albany, and New York City, N. Y.,
Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, Harrisburg, Philadelphia,
Pittsburg, and Erie, Pa., Hartford, Conn., Nashville, Tenn.,
St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo., Montreal, P. Q., Toronto
and Ottawa, Ont., Baltimore, Md., and Minneapolis, Minn.
At present (1918) over 3,000 million gallons per day are being
chlorinated in North America and more than 1,000 cities
and towns are employing this process.</p>

<h3>MODUS OPERANDI</h3>


<p><a name="Sec2_1" id="Sec2_1"></a>Before considering the &#8220;modus operandi&#8221; of chlorine
and hypochlorites, it will be advisable to take up the composition
of the latter substances and particularly that of
&#8220;bleach.&#8221; Bleach is manufactured by passing chlorine
gas over slaked lime and the ensuing reactions are often
represented by the equation Ca(OH)<span class="denom">2</span> + Cl<span class="denom">2</span>
= CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O.
This represents the substance formed as a pure oxychloride
of calcium which contains approximately 50 per cent of
chlorine, but the article commercially produced never contains
this amount of chlorine, the usual percentage being
from 35-37. The general composition of commercial bleach
is fairly uniform. This is shown in the following analyses of
which two are of German bleach examined by Lunge and
one of Canadian manufacture analysed by the author.</p>

<p>From these analyses the constitutional of commercial
bleach might be represented by the formula</p>

<p class="ind10">4CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;2Ca(OH)<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;5H<span
class="denom">2</span>O</p>

<p>which assumes it to contain:</p>

<p>In this formula calcium hypochlorite has been written
CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span>, but this substance actually contains one atom of
oxygen less than the true hypochlorite, which has the constitutional
formula ClO-Ca-OCl. This difference led
some of the earlier chemists to regard CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span> as a mixture
of equal molecules of calcium chloride and calcium hypochlorite
(CaCl<span class="denom">2</span> + Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> = 2CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span>), but it has been
definitely established that no calcium chloride exists in the
free state in dry commercial bleach.</p>

<p>Since the very earliest days when the process of bleaching
was investigated it was considered to be a process of oxidation
and it is not surprising that Lavoisier and his pupils,
who had noted the strong decolourising action of the gas discovered
previously by Scheele, should regard it as a compound
that contained oxygen. They were confirmed in
this view by the fact that an aqueous solution of the gas
slowly evolved oxygen when placed in bright sunlight, and
lost its bleaching properties. Watt disproved this and
showed that the evolution of oxygen was due to the action
of the chlorine on water.</p>

<p class="ind10">Cl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = 2HCl + O.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_2" id="Sec2_2"></a>The bleaching action was not due to the chlorine &#8220;per se&#8221;
but to the nascent oxygen produced in the presence of moisture.
Later, when bleach and other chlorine compounds
came into use as deodourisers, their action was attributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the oxygen produced and when their germicidal properties
became known it was natural to assume that the destruction
of bacteria was due to the same cause. Some of the
earlier experimental work supported this view. Fischer
and Proskauer<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_1" id="Fnanchor2_1"></a><a
href="#Fn2_1">[1]</a></span> found that humidity played an important
part in chlorine disinfection, probably because it favoured
oxidation. In air saturated with moisture micro-organisms
were killed by 0.3 per cent of chlorine in three hours but
when the air was dry practically no action occurred. They
concluded that chlorine was not directly toxic. Warouzoff,
Winogradoff, and Kolessnikoff<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_2" id="Fnanchor2_2"></a><a
href="#Fn2_2">[2]</a></span> were unable to confirm the
results of Fischer and Proskauer and found that a mixture of
chlorine gas and air killed tetanus spores in one minute.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_3" id="Sec2_3"></a>The nascent oxygen hypothesis was clearly and succinctly
expressed by Prof. Leal during the hearing of the
Boonton, N. J., case and the following abstracts have been
taken from his evidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;... That on the addition of bleach to water the
loosely formed combination forming the bleach splits up
into chloride of calcium and hypochlorite of calcium. The
chloride of calcium being inert, the hypochlorite acted upon
by the carbonic acid in the water either free or half bound,
splits up into carbonate of calcium and hypochlorous acid.
The hypochlorous acid in the presence of oxidisable matter
gives off its oxygen; hydrochloric acid being left. The
hydrochloric acid then drives off the weaker carbonic acid
and unites with the calcium forming chloride of calcium.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the process was wholly an oxidising one, the work
being done entirely by the oxygen set free from the hypochlorous
acids in the presence of oxidizable matter....</p>

<p>&#8220;We have used during our investigations, the term
&#8216;potential oxygen&#8217; as expressing its factor of power. When
set free, it is really nascent or atomic oxygen and is, in its
most active state, entirely different from the oxygen normally
in water....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The reactions suggested are expressed in the following

<p>Phelps, during the hearing of this case, suggested that
hypochlorites were directly toxic to micro-organisms but
this view was not supported by any definite evidence and
the nascent oxygen hypothesis met with almost universal
acceptance. Investigations made by the author in 1915,
1916 and 1917 have produced data which cannot be adequately
explained by the nascent oxygen hypothesis.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_3" id="Fnanchor2_3"></a><a
href="#Fn2_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The disinfecting action of bleach can be most conveniently
considered by regarding it as a heterogeneous mixture
of the reactants and resultants of the reaction</p>

<p class="ind10">CaO + H<span class="denom">2</span>O + Cl<span class="denom">2</span> &#8594;
CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O</p>

<p>which is in equilibrium for the temperature and pressure
obtaining during the process of manufacture. Under suitable
physical conditions the chlorine content can be increased
to 40-42 per cent but such a product is not so stable as those
represented by the analyses on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a> and which contain
approximately 20 per cent of excess hydrate of lime. The
stability of bleach depends upon this excess of base (Griffen
and Hedallen<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn2_4">[4]</a></span>) and although magnesia can be partially
substituted for this excess of lime, a minimum of 5 per cent
of free hydrate of lime is required to ensure stability.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_4" id="Sec2_4"></a>On dissolving bleach in water the first action is the
decomposition of calcium oxychloride into an equal number
of molecules of calcium hypochlorite and calcium chloride.</p>

<p class="ind10">2CaOCl<span class="denom">2</span> = Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> + CaCl<span class="denom">2</span>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In dilute solution these salts are dissociated and hydrolysis
tends to occur in accordance with the equations</p>

<p class="ind10">2Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> + 4H<span class="denom">2</span>O &#8644; 2Ca(OH)<span
class="denom">2</span> + HOCl + HCl and</p>

<p class="ind10">CaCl<span class="denom">2</span> + 2H<span class="denom">2</span>O &#8644; Ca(OH)<span class="denom">2</span> + 2HCl.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_5" id="Sec2_5"></a>Calcium hydrate and hydrochloric acid are both practically
completely dissociated, i.e. there is a large and equal quantity
of H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> and OH&#8242;, and the product is much greater than K<span class="denom"><i>w</i></span>
(ionic product of water), and hence there is a combination
of these ions, leaving the solution neutral and no undissociated
acid or base exists. This statement is only approximately
correct as hydrochloric acid is slightly more dissociated
than calcium hydroxide (ratio 9&nbsp;:&nbsp;8) and the
solution is consequently slightly acid, i.e. the H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> concentration
is greater than 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">-7</span>.</p>

<p>Hypochlorous acid is only very slightly dissociated,
especially in the presence of the OCl&#8242; ion due to the dissociation
of the Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span>, as compared with Ca(OH)<span class="denom">2</span> and
hydrolysis of the Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> proceeds with increased dilution.
The action is best represented by the equation</p>

<p class="ind10">2Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> + 2H<span class="denom">2</span>O &#8644;
CaCl<span class="denom">2</span> + Ca(OH)<span class="denom">2</span> + 2HOCl</p>

<p>The hydrolytic constant of hypochlorous acid has apparently
not been determined but as the acid is weaker than carbonic
acid, which has a hydrolytic constant of 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">-4</span>, the value
is probably between 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">-3</span> and 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">-4</span>. From the
formula <i>x</i><span class="enum">2</span>&#8260;(1 - <i>x</i>)<i>v</i> = <i>k</i><span class="denom"><i>wv</i></span>
in which 1 mole of pure Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span>
is dissolved in <i>v</i> litres, <i>x</i> is the fraction hydrolysed, and <i>k</i><span class="denom"><i>wv</i></span>
is the hydrolytic constant, complete hydrolysis occurs
(<i>x</i> = 1) when <i>v</i> is not greater than 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">4</span> litres. This is
equivalent to a concentration of not less than 7.1 p.p.m.
of available chlorine. Solutions of pure hypochlorites are
alkaline in reaction because of the excess of hydroxyl ions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>(minimum concentration
1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<span class="enum">-4</span>). In solutions of bleach
the hydrolytic action is retarded by the OH&#8242; due to the free
base, and accelerated by the excess of H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> caused by the
dissociation and partial hydrolysis of CaCl<span class="denom">2</span>; the final
result is determined by the relative proportions and the
effect of the free base usually preponderates. The addition
of any substance that reduces the OH&#8242; concentration enables
hydrolysis to proceed to completion and affords a rational
explanation of the fact that solutions of bleach, on distillation
with such weak acids as boric acid, yield a solution
of hypochlorous acid. It also explains why the addition
of an acid is necessary in Bunsen&#8217;s method (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>)
of analysing hypochlorite solutions. It has been stated
that when hydrochloric acid is employed the increase in the
oxidising power is due to the action of the acid upon calcium
chloride but this never occurs under ordinary conditions; weak
acids such as carbonic or acetic will give practically the same
result as hydrochloric acid in solutions of bleach of the strength
used in water treatment. The slightly higher result obtained
with strong acids is due to the decomposition of chlorates.</p>

<p>The effect of dilution alone is shown by the data given
below. A 2 per cent bleach solution, containing very little
excess base, was diluted with distilled water and the various
dilutions titrated with thiosulphate after the addition of
potassium iodide. In one series the solutions were titrated
directly, and after acidification in the other. The results<a name="Fnanchor2A" id="Fnanchor2A"></a><span

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Although every precaution was taken to exclude carbonic
acid, a portion of the hydrolysis was probably due to this
acid, which would remove calcium hydrate from the sphere
of action and consequently alter the equilibrium. The
above figures are only applicable to the particular sample
used; other samples containing different excesses of base
would yield different hydrolytic values. The results are in
agreement with the hypothesis presented and confirm the
theoretical deduction that very dilute bleach solutions are
completely hydrolysed if no salts are present that will dissociate
and increase the OH&#8242; concentration. Hydrolysis is
reduced by caustic alkalies and alkaline carbonates, and
increased by acids and acid carbonates that reduce the OH&#8242;
concentration.</p>

<p>The effect of chlorides is anomalous and no adequate
explanation for their action can be given at present. The
addition of small quantities of sodium chloride (0.1 per cent)
increases the hydrolysis of bleach solutions but much larger
quantities tend to the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The effect of these substances upon the velocity of the
germicidal action of bleach solutions is in the same direction
as the hydrolysing effect.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn2_4">[4]</a></span> Sodium chloride in quantities
up to 10 parts per million has a very limited effect but
larger quantities (90 p.p.m.) increase the velocity of the
reaction. Sodium chloride, in the absence of hypochlorites,
was found to have no influence upon the viability of <i>B. coli</i>
in water.</p>

<p>In quantities up to approximately 5 p.p.m., sodium
hydroxide has but little influence; 5-10 p.p.m. reduce the
velocity to a marked degree, but when the quantity of caustic
is still further increased the germicidal action of the alkali
commences to be appreciable and may nullify the retarding
action on the hypochlorite. Normal carbonates tend to
reduce the velocity of the germicidal action and bicarbonates
to increase it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Sulphuric acid, even in very small quantities (5 p.p.m.),
has a marked accelerating effect and the total effect produced
is much greater than can be accounted for by the
germicidal activity of the acid alone. Weak acids such as
carbonic acid and acetic acid are also effective accelerators.
In one experiment a 0.01 per cent solution of bleach was
found to be 40 per cent hydrolysed. By passing carbonic
acid gas this was increased to 95 per cent and the velocity
of the germicidal action of this solution was found to be
approximately 100 per cent greater than that of the uncarbonated
one. Norton and Hsu<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_5" id="Fnanchor2_5"></a><a href="#Fn2_5">[5]</a></span> have shown that the
germicidal activity of some disinfectants is a function of
the hydrogen ion concentration, but this factor is insufficient
to account for the effect of acids on bleach solutions.</p>

<p>The effect of sodium chloride on the bacteriological
results, like that on the hydrolytic constant, is anomalous.
Similar effects have been observed on the addition of this
salt to phenol and other disinfectants. The <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i>
of the increased activity is obscure but it is possible that
the salt renders the organisms more susceptible to the
action of the germicide.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_6" id="Sec2_6"></a>Ammonia, though decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration
of bleach and other hypochlorite solutions, markedly
increases the velocity of the reaction; chlorinated derivatives
of ammonia (chloramines), which have a specific germicidal

<p>Rideal<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn2_6">[6]</a></span> has shown that the addition of ammonia to
sodium hypochlorite destroys the bleaching activity in
acid solution. This has been found by the author to be
also true for calcium hypochlorite (bleach). If the bleaching
effect is due to oxidation, the oxidising power of hypochlorites
must be considered to be destroyed by the addition
of ammonia. The property of oxidising organic matter in
water is also destroyed; this is well illustrated in <a href="#Tab2">Table II</a><span

which shows the rate of absorption of chlorine and chloramine
by the Ottawa River water. The water used in this
experiment contained 40 p.p.m. of colour and absorbed
9.5 p.p.m. of oxygen (30 mins. at 100&deg; C.).</p>

<p>From a consideration of these and other experiments
made by the author in January, 1916, it became apparent
that the nascent oxygen hypothesis entirely failed to explain
the results obtained, and that they must be attributed to a
direct toxic action of the chlorine or chloramine.</p>

<p>Dakin et al.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_7"
id="Fnanchor2_7"></a><a href="#Fn2_7">[7]</a></span> arrived at a similar conclusion from a consideration
of the results obtained during the use of hypochlorite
solutions in the treatment of wounds by Carrel&#8217;s
method of irrigation. They attributed the marked beneficial
action to the formation of chloramines <i>in situ</i> by the
action of hypochlorous acid upon amino acids and proteid
bodies. Compound chloramines (chlorinated aminobenzoic
acids) were prepared in the laboratory and found to
give excellent results in reducing wound infection. Later,
other compounds were prepared for the purpose of sterilising
small quantities of water for the use of mobile troops (see
<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_7" id="Sec2_7"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Rideal<span class="fnanchor"><a
href="#Fn2_6">[6]</a></span> was the first to note the strong germicidal power
of chloramine and attributed the persistent germicidal
activity of hypochlorites in sewage to the formation of
chloramine and chloramine derivatives.</p>

<p>Further evidence against the nascent oxygen theory of
chlorine disinfection is to be found in the fact that such
active oxidising agents as sodium, potassium, and hydrogen
peroxides have a much lower germicidal activity than
chlorine when compared on the basis of their oxygen equivalents.
<a href="#Tab3">Table III</a> shows chlorine to be approximately five
times as active as potassium permanganate when compared
on this basis.</p>

<p>Again, solutions of chlorine gas and hypochlorites having
the same oxidising activity, as determined by titration with
thiosulphate after the addition of potassium iodide and
acid, i.e. contain equal amounts of available chlorine, show
approximately the same germicidal activity in water. On the
addition of ammonia, the hypochlorite solutions retain their
ability to liberate iodine from potassium iodide (Wagner
test) but the property of oxidising such dyestuffs as indigo
is destroyed and the germicidal activity is increased. Ammonia,
when added to solutions of chlorine gas, diminishes
the property of liberating iodine from potassium iodide,
the bleaching effect on dyestuffs, and the germicidal action.
It is often assumed that chlorine forms hypochlorous acid
on solution in water Cl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = HClO + HCl but the results
obtained on the addition of ammonia indicate that either
very little hypochlorous acid is formed or that ammonia and

<p>Even when the ratio of Cl&nbsp;:&nbsp;NH<span class="denom">3</span> was 4&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 by weight,
practically the same as was used in the experiments of
Noyes and Lyon, and Bray and Dowell, quoted above, the
germicidal action was totally destroyed and the 24-hour
results showed aftergrowths which were somewhat proportional
to the amount of ammonia added. This was
probably due to the formation of ammonium chloride, which
provided additional nutriment for the organisms.</p>

<p>It has often been assumed that hypochlorite solutions
are decomposed on addition to water containing free or
half-bound carbonic acid with the production of free chlorine,
but no evidence has been adduced in support. Free chlorine
can be separated from hypochlorous acid in aqueous solution
by extraction with carbon tetrachloride and when this
solvent is shaken with a carbonated hypochlorite solution
it is found that only traces of chlorine are removed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Hypochlorous acid reacts with hydrochloric acid with
the evolution of free chlorine HClO + HCl = Cl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O but
in very dilute solution the amount of free chlorine formed is
exceedingly minute. Jakowkin<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_10"
id="Fnanchor2_10"></a><a href="#Fn2_10">[10]</a></span> has shown that this
reaction does not proceed to completion and that the concentration
of free chlorine can be calculated from the equation
HClO &times; H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> &times; Cl&#8242; = 320Cl<span class="denom">2</span>
in which the reactions are expressed
in gram molecules per litre. The hydrogen ions and chlorine ions
are obtained from the dissociation of carbonic acid
(H<span class="denom">2</span>CO<span class="denom">3</span> &#8644; H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> +
HCO<span class="denom">3</span>&#8242;) and chlorides (NaCl &#8644; Na<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> + Cl&#8242;) and
also by the dissociation of hydrochloric acid produced by the
interaction of hypochlorous acid and organic matter.
HClO = O + HCl &#8644; H<span class="enum"><b>&middot;</b></span> + Cl&#8242;. If the formula of Jakowkin
can be correctly applied to solutions containing fractions of
a part per million of hypochlorous acid the free chlorine
liberated by the addition of 1 p.p.m. of bleach to a water
low in chlorides would be of the order 10<span class="enum">-7</span>-10<span class="enum">-8</span> p.p.m.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_9" id="Sec2_9"></a><i>Sodium hypochlorite</i> is probably hydrolysed in dilute
solution in a manner similar to that of bleach.</p>

<p class="ind10">2NaOCl = NaCl + NaOH + HClO.</p>

<p>For solutions containing equal amounts of available chlorine,
electrolytic sodium hypochlorite is more dissociated than
bleach because of the absence of an excess of base, and this,
together with the presence of sodium chloride, accounts
for the slightly higher germicidal velocity obtained. The
experience of pulp mills, with bleach and electrolytic hypochlorites,
confirms this: the latter is a much quicker bleaching
agent than bleach and it is often so rapid as to make it
desirable to reduce the velocity by the addition of soda ash.</p>

<p>Regarding hypochlorite solutions a phenomenon of
more scientific interest than of practical importance has
been noted by Breteau<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_12"
id="Fnanchor2_12"></a><a href="#Fn2_12">[12]</a></span> who found that alkaline solutions
of sodium hypochlorite containing 0.94 per cent of available
chlorine lost 3.6 per cent of their titer on dilution with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
80 volumes of water; also that this loss was increased by
the addition of small quantities of salt (sodium chloride)
and more so by carbonates and bicarbonates. The author
has noted similar losses on diluting bleach solutions and
that the loss increased on standing. The loss can be
explained by the decomposition of hypochlorous acid, in the
presence of light, into hydrochloric acid and oxygen.
2HClO = 2HCl + O<span class="denom">2</span></p>

<p><a name="Sec2_10" id="Sec2_10"></a><span class="smcap">Chlorine Water.</span> When a solution of chlorine in water
is used as a germicide the chemical reactions that occur
differ materially from those of hypochlorite solutions. On
solution in water, hydration or solvation probably takes
place with the production of heat. Cl<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;Aq. = 2,600 calories.
Chlorine water is comparatively stable but decomposes
under the influence of light in accordance with the equation
Cl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = 2HCl + O; a similar reaction occurs in the
presence of organic matter or any substance capable of
oxidation. Chlorine water contains only minute traces of
hypochlorous acid and there is no evidence that the endothermic
reaction</p>

<p class="ind10">Cl<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;Aq + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = HClO&middot;Aq + HCl&middot;Aq<br />
-2600 - 68,460 = -29,930 - 39,315 - 1815</p>

<p>occurs in a measurable degree.</p>

<p>From thermochemical considerations hypochlorous acid
and chlorine water should be about equally active as oxidising
agents.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_11" id="Sec2_11"></a>When a solution of chlorine or hypochlorite is added to
water as a germicidal agent, a variety of reactions occur the
character of which is determined by the nature of the mineral
and organic matter in the water and the type of chlorine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
compound added. The general reactions are of three types
(1) oxidation of the organic matter, (2) direct chlorination
of the organic matter, and (3) a bactericidal action.</p>

<p>In the treatment of waters that contain appreciable
amounts of organic matter almost all the chlorine is consumed
in reaction (1) and even with filter effluents it is
probably true that oxidation accounts for the greater portion
of the chlorine consumed. The author has found that
a dosage of 0.02 part per million of available chlorine was
more effective in destroying <i>B. coli</i> in distilled water than
0.40 p.p.m. in a water absorbing 9.5 p.p.m. of oxygen (30
mins. at 100&deg; C.).</p>

<p>Reaction (1) can be adequately explained by the nascent
oxygen hypothesis and it is this reaction that determines the
dosage required for effective sterilisation. (See <a href="#Ch3">Chap. III</a>.)</p>

<p>Very little information is available regarding reaction
(2) but there is little doubt that a direct chlorination of the
organic matter does occur and it is more than probable that
these chlorinated derivatives are largely responsible for the
obnoxious tastes and odours produced in some waters. It
has been suggested that these were due to the formation
of chloramines. This view was formerly supported by the
author but the chloramine treatment at Ottawa and other
places has demonstrated the inadequacy of this explanation.
It is true that the odour of chloramine is stronger and more
pungent than that of chlorine, but chloramine in the Ottawa
supply, even with doses as high as 0.5 part per million of
available chlorine, has caused no complaints.</p>

<p>The odour of some of the organo-chloro compounds is
more penetrating and obnoxious than those of chlorine and
chloramine, and it is quite possible that some of the higher
homologues of chloramine are in this class. It should be
noted, however, that some of the chloro-amido compounds
prepared by Dakin are white, odourless, crystalline substances.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Practically nothing is known regarding the specific nature
of the mechanism involved in reaction (3). The hypothesis
that chlorine, and chlorine compounds, exert a direct toxic
action on the micro-organisms marks an advance in the
science of water treatment but does not indicate the physiological
processes involved. Cross and Bevan<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor2_11"
id="Fnanchor2_11"></a><a href="#Fn2_11">[11]</a></span> have shown
that chloro-amines have a tendency to combine with nitrogenous
molecules and to become fixed on cellulose; it is
therefore possible that reaction is a cytolytic one in which
the chlorine attacks and partially or wholly destroys the
membranous envelope of the organisms. A portion of the
chlorine or chlorine-compound may also penetrate the membrane
and produce changes that result in the death of the
organism.</p>

<h3>DOSAGE</h3>


<p><a name="Sec3_1" id="Sec3_1"></a>The amount of chlorine required for efficient treatment
is very largely determined by the amount required to satisfy
the oxidisable matter present in the water. Many experimenters
have reported results that would indicate that
appreciable concentrations of chlorine are required for
bactericidal action but the details of the technique, as published,
show that the effect of the organic matter added
with the test organism was not thoroughly appreciated.
One cubic centimetre of a culture in ordinary peptone water,
added to one litre of water, would increase the organic
content by approximately 10 parts per million, an amount
that would absorb appreciable amounts of chlorine.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_2" id="Sec3_2"></a>Other conditions also make it very difficult to compare the
results obtained in the past: one of these is the degree of
purity set as the objective. German bacteriologists added
enormous numbers of the test organism and endeavoured
to obtain the complete removal of the organism from such
quantities as one litre of water with a contact period often
as short as 10 minutes. Nissen,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_1"
id="Fnanchor3_1"></a><a href="#Fn3_1">[1]</a></span> of the Hygienic Institute
of Berlin, found that a 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;800 dilution of bleach (420 p.p.m.
of chlorine) was required to destroy <i>B. typhosus</i> in one minute
and a 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1600 dilution (210 p.p.m. of chlorine) in 10 minutes.
Del&eacute;pine<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_2"
id="Fnanchor3_2"></a><a href="#Fn3_2">[2]</a></span> obtained somewhat similar results by means
of the thread method for testing disinfectants. Phelps,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_3"
id="Fnanchor3_3"></a><a href="#Fn3_3">[3]</a></span>
using gelatine plates for enumeration of the bacteria, obtained
a 90 per cent reduction of <i>B. typhosus</i> in twenty minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with 5 p.p.m. of available chlorine; over 99 per cent reduction
in one hour, and over 99.99 per cent reduction in 18
hours. Wesbrook, Whittaker, and Mohler<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_4"
id="Fnanchor3_4"></a><a href="#Fn3_4">[4]</a></span> tested bleach
solutions with various strains of <i>B. typhosus</i> by means of
the plate method and found that the most resistant one was
reduced from 20,000 per c.cm. to sterility (in 1 c.cm.) by
3 p.p.m. of available chlorine in fifty minutes and that the
least resistant one only required 1.0 p.p.m. with a thirty
minutes&#8217; contact.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_3" id="Sec3_3"></a>Lederer and Bachmann<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_5"
id="Fnanchor3_5"></a><a href="#Fn3_5">[5]</a></span> have reported the following results:</p>

<p>With the exception of <i>P. mirabilis</i>, which forms endospores,
all the organisms were killed (less than 1 per c.cm.) by 0.5
p.p.m. of available chlorine in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>All these observers found that <i>B. coli</i>, the organism
usually employed as an index of contamination, had approximately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the same degree of resistance to chlorine as <i>B. typhosus</i>,
though Wesbrook et al. directed attention to the varying
viability of organisms derived from different sources.</p>

<p>These experiments merely indicate the dosage required
for exceptional conditions such as it is inconceivable would
ever occur in water-works practice. No information is
available regarding the actual <i>B. typhosus</i> content of waters
that have caused epidemics of typhoid fever, but for the present
purpose it may be assumed that the extreme condition
would be a pollution by fresh sewage giving a <i>B. coli</i> content
of 1,000 per c.cm. or 200 times worse than the average condition
that can be satisfactorily purified without overloading
a filter plant (500 <i>B. coli</i> per 100 c.cms.). Experiments
made by the author indicate that a suspension of
1,000 <i>B. coli</i> per c.cm. in water, in the absence of organic
matter, can be reduced to a 2 <i>B. coli</i> per 100 c.cms. standard
(the U.S. Treasury Standard) by 0.1 p.p.m. of available
chlorine in ten minutes at 65&deg; F. This experiment indicates
the amount of chlorine that is required for the bactericidal
action only; such a dosage could never be used in practice
to meet a pollution of this degree because of the accompanying
organic matter. In actual practice the author has
experienced the above condition but once, and on that
occasion the <i>B. coli</i> were derived from soil washings and not
from fresh sewage.</p>

<p>The amount of chlorine required for germicidal action
is small, and the main factors that determine the dosage
necessary to obtain this action are (1) the content of readily
oxidisable organic matter, (2) the temperature of the water,
(3) the method of application of the chlorine and (4) the
contact period.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_4" id="Sec3_4"></a><b>Oxidisable Matter.</b> The oxidisable matter may be divided
into two classes (<i>a</i>) inorganic and (<i>b</i>) organic. The inorganic
constituents naturally found in water, that are readily
oxidisable, are ferrous salts (usually carbonates), nitrites,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and sulphuretted hydrogen, and these react quantitatively
with chlorine until fully oxidised. The oxygen value of
chlorine is approximately one-quarter (actually 16&nbsp;:&nbsp;71)
the available chlorine content in accordance with the equation
Cl<span class="denom">2</span>/71 + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = 2HCl + O/16. One part per million of available
chlorine will oxidise 1.58 p.p.m. of ferrous iron; 0.197 p.p.m.
of nitrous nitrogen; and 0.479 p.p.m. of sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p>The organic matter found in water may be derived from
various substances such as urea, amido compounds, and cellulose;
humus bodies derived from soil washings and swamps
may also be present. The humus compounds of swamps
and muskeg are usually associated with the characteristic
colour of the water derived from these sources. The effect
of this coloured organic matter upon the chlorine dosage
is well illustrated in <a href="#Tab6">Table VI</a>. In this experiment <i>B. coli</i>
was used as the test organism and the only varying factor
was the organic matter. To obtain the same result with a
contact period of one hour at 63&deg; F. it was necessary to
use about two and one-half times the amount of chlorine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with a water containing 40 p.p.m. of colour as with one
practically free from colour. It will be noted that water
&#8220;A,&#8221; in which the colour had been reduced to 3 p.p.m. by
coagulation with aluminium sulphate, required a greater
dosage of chlorine than was necessary for bactericidal action
only. This was due to a residual organic content which
produced none or but a trace of colour, for although the colour
had been reduced by 92 per cent the organic matter, as
measured by the oxygen absorbed test, had only been
reduced by 70 per cent.</p>

<p>The results obtained by Harrington<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_6"
id="Fnanchor3_6"></a><a href="#Fn3_6">[6]</a></span> at Montreal are
in the same direction. During the greater part of the year
the water is obtained from the St. Lawrence river, which is
colourless and low in organic matter; in the spring months
the flood waters of the Ottawa, a highly coloured river,
enter the intake and necessitated a much higher dosage.</p>

somewhat resembled that of a mono-molecular reaction and
the results were calculated accordingly. The mathematical
expression of this law is <i>dN</i>/<i>dt</i> = <i>KN</i> where <i>N</i> is the concentration
of the available chlorine in parts per million. Integrating
between <i>t</i><span class="denom">1</span> and <i>t</i><span class="denom">2</span> the formula <i>K</i> =

the compound absorbing the chlorine were simple in character,
and the chlorine were present in large excess, the value of <i>K</i>
would be constant. In the experiments recorded, <i>K</i> constantly
decreases, due to the decreasing concentrations of
the reacting substances and the complex nature of the organic

<p>The value of 0.4 (0.39) obtained by the author is the average
of over one hundred determinations covering a period of two
years. The experiments of Zaleski and Elmanovitsch were
made with the water of the Neva River.</p>

<p>The divergence in the ratios affords additional evidence
in favor of reaction (2) mentioned on <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a> and also shows
that the chlorinated compounds are less readily oxidized than
those from which they are produced. Heise<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_8"
id="Fnanchor3_8"></a><a href="#Fn3_8">[8]</a></span> has found
that the amount of chlorine consumed is usually proportional
to the concentration in which it is added though not necessarily
a function of the concentration of the organic matter.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_6" id="Sec3_6"></a><b>Temperature.</b> The evidence regarding the effect of temperature
upon the dosage required is somewhat conflicting.
Ellms (<i><a href="#Ellms">vide supra</a></i>) found that the velocity of the germicidal
action varied directly with the temperature and this has also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been the author&#8217;s experience with laboratory experiments.

<p>The reaction velocity of a germicide is proportional to the

<p><a href="#Tab8">Tables VIII</a> and <a href="#Tab9">IX</a>, however, show that the temperature
coefficient of the germicidal action has a greater effect than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the reduction in the amount of chlorine absorbed and removed
from the reaction.</p>

<p>The results obtained on the works scale with these waters
are very different to the laboratory ones and show that more
chlorine is required during the summer season than in winter.
The results with bleach and liquid chlorine are in the same
direction (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Diag3">Diagrams III</a> and <a href="#Diag4">IV</a>). The bleach was regulated
so as to maintain a constant purity, whilst in the other
case the dosage was constant with a varying <i>B. coli</i> content.
In <a href="#Diag4">Diagram IV</a> the <i>B. coli</i> is plotted; this does not represent
all the factors involved as the <i>B. coli</i> content of the treated
water is also a function of that of the raw water, but in the
example given this factor is of no moment because it was
comparatively constant during the period plotted (extreme
variation 80 per cent).</p>

<p>The discrepancies between the laboratory and works results
cannot be easily explained. The only difference in the conditions
is the nature of the containing vessel. Glass is practically
inert at all temperatures but the iron pipes, through
which the water passed before the samples were taken, may
exert an absorptive influence on the chlorine at the higher
temperatures experienced during the summer months.</p>

<p>Waters containing organic matter that differs much in
quantity from the examples above may yield very different
results and no generalisation can be made that will cover all
cases. An increase of temperature increases the germicidal
velocity and also the rate of absorption of chlorine by the
organic matter; other factors determine which of these competitive
actions predominates.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_7" id="Sec3_7"></a><b>Method of Application (admixture).</b> A thorough admixture
of the water and chlorine is a <i>sine qua non</i> for successful
operation. This should, if possible, be attained by natural
means, but if there is any doubt as to the efficiency of the mixing
process, mechanical appliances should be utilised. Pumps,
especially centrifugal pumps, constitute a very convenient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and efficacious method of mixing the germicide and the water,
and the solutions should never be injected into the discharge
pipes when it is possible to make connections with the suctions.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></p>

<p>Inefficient admixture leads to local concentration of the
chlorine, a condition which (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>), results in a wastage
of the disinfectant. Two practical examples of this effect
may be cited. In one case the water was free from colour
and contained very little organic matter. This water was
chlorinated at one plant by allowing the bleach solution to
drop into one vertical limb of a syphon approximately 6,000
feet long, the other vertical limb being used as a suction well
for the pumps which discharged into the distribution mains.
At the other plant the bleach solution was injected into the
discharge pipe of a reciprocating pump through a pipe perforated
with a number of small holes. The results for two
typical months are given in <a href="#Tab10">Table X</a>.</p>

<p>The results with the &#8220;B&#8221; plant were very irregular.
The hypochlorite and water did not mix thoroughly and, as
several suctions pipes were situated in the suction shaft,
there was no subsequent admixture in the pumps; this also
caused complaints regarding taste and odour but the complaints
were localised, and not general as would result from
an overdose of solution due to irregularities at the plant.</p>

<p>The second example deals with a water containing 40-45
p.p.m. of colour. This supply was taken from the river by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
low-lift pumps and discharged into a header which was connected
with the high-lift pumps by two intake pipes about
5,000 feet in length. During 1914 a baffled storage basin of
two hours capacity was constructed and in June the hypochlorite

<p>Here again thorough admixture produced better results
than inefficient admixture plus a longer contact period.
Langer<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_10"
id="Fnanchor3_10"></a><a href="#Fn3_10">[10]</a></span> has also noted the effect of local concentration and
found that the disinfecting action is increased by adding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bleach solution in fractions, a cumulative effect replacing
that of concentration.</p>

<p>The importance of the admixture factor was not thoroughly
appreciated during the earlier periods of chlorination
but later installations, and particularly the liquid chlorine
ones, have been designed to take full advantage of it.</p>

<p>The point of application in American water-works practice
varies considerably (Longley<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn3_11">[11]</a></span>). In 57 per cent of those
cases in which it is employed as an adjunct to filtration, it is
used in the final treatment; in 26 per cent it is used after
coagulation or sedimentation and before filtration; in the
remaining 17 per cent it is applied before coagulation and filtration.
The report of the committee adds: &#8220;The data at
hand do not give any reasons for the application before coagulation.
In general, an effective disinfection may be secured
with a smaller quantity of hypochlorite, if it is applied after
rather than before filtration. It should be noted that the
storage of chlorinated water in coagulating basins, and its
passage through filters, tend to lessen tastes and odors contributed
by the treatment and this fact may in some cases
account for its use in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_8" id="Sec3_8"></a><b>Contact Period.</b> Other things being equal, the efficiency
of the treatment will vary directly, within certain limits,
with the contact period. When a chlorinated water has to
be pumped to the distribution mains directly after treatment,
the dosage must be high enough to secure the desired standard
of purity within twenty to thirty minutes. The chlorine is
sometimes not completely absorbed in this period and may
cause complaints as to tastes and odours. The examples
given above show that the lack of contact period can be
largely compensated by ensuring proper admixture. Experience
has amply demonstrated that there is no necessity
to use heroic doses for water that is delivered for consumption
almost immediately after treatment, and that, with proper
supervision, complaints can be almost entirely prevented.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_9" id="Sec3_9"></a><b>Turbidity</b> is usually considered to exert an effect upon
the dosage required but no definite evidence has been adduced
in support of this hypothesis. Turbidity is generally caused
by the presence of very finely divided suspended matter,
usually silt or clay, which is inert to hypochlorites. The condition
that produces turbidity, however, produces a concomitant
increase in the pollution and some of the organisms are
embedded in mineral or organic material that prevents access
of the chlorine to the organisms which consequently survive
treatment. A larger concentration is required to meet these
conditions but it is not necessitated by the turbidity <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_11" id="Sec3_11"></a><b>Determination of Dosage Required.</b> The dosage required
for the treatment of a water can only be accurately determined
by treating samples with various amounts of chlorine
and estimating the number of bacteria and <i>B. coli</i> after an
interval of time equal to that available in practice. The
temperature of the water during the experiment should be
the same as that of the water at the time of sampling.</p>

<p>In order to limit the range covered by the experiments the
approximate dosage can be ascertained from <a href="#Diag5">Diagram V</a> if the
amount of oxygen absorbed by the water is known. This
diagram is calculated on the amount of available chlorine,
present as chlorine or hypochlorite, that will reduce the
<i>B. coli</i> content to the U. S. Treasury standard (2 <i>B. coli</i> per
100 c.cms.) in two hours. If the oxygen absorbed values are
determined by the four-hour test at 27&deg; C. they should be
multiplied by two.</p>

<p>Another method which has been generally adopted for
military work during the war, consists in the addition of
definite volumes of a standard chlorine solution to several
samples of the water and, after a definite interval, testing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for the presence of free chlorine by the starch-iodide reaction.
The details of the method of Gascard and Laroche, which
is used by the French sanitary service, have been given by
Comte.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_12"
id="Fnanchor3_12"></a><a href="#Fn3_12">[12]</a></span> One hundred c.cms. of the water to be examined
are placed in each of 5 vessels and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 drops of
dilute Eau de Javelle (1&nbsp;:&nbsp;100) are added and the contents
stirred. After twenty minutes, 1 c.cm. of potassium iodide-starch
reagent (1 gram each of starch, potassium, iodide and
crystallized sodium carbonate to 100 c.cms.) is added and the
samples again stirred. The lowest dilution showing a definite
blue colour is regarded as the dose required, and the number
of drops is identical with that required of the undiluted Eau
de Javelle for 10 litres of water when the same dropping
instrument is used. The actual concentration represented
by these dilutions depends necessarily upon the size of the
drops and the strength of the undiluted Eau de Javelle,
but one drop per 100 c.cms. usually represents approximately
1 p.p.m.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>In Horrocks&#8217;s method, as used in the British army, a
standard bleach solution is added and is almost immediately
followed by the zinc iodide-starch reagent. The two methods
were compared by Massy,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor3_13"
id="Fnanchor3_13"></a><a href="#Fn3_13">[13]</a></span> who found that the French
method gave an average result of only 0.06 m.gr. per litre
(0.06 p.p.m.) higher than the English method. Water in the
Gallipoli campaign required from 0.21 to 1.06 p.p.m. as
determined by both methods.</p>

<p>Di&eacute;nert, Director of the Paris Service for investigating
drinking water, adds 3 p.p.m. of available chlorine and
allows the mixture to stand fifteen minutes after shaking;
the residual chlorine is then titrated with thiosulphate. The
amount absorbed is increased by 0.5 p.p.m. and in the
opinion of Di&eacute;nert this dosage is correct for a contact period
of three hours.</p>

<p>For military camps where a standpipe usually provides a
reasonable contact period, it has been found good practice
to add sufficient chlorine to give a rich blue colour with the
starch-iodide reagent and subsequently reduce the dosage
gradually until the water, after standing one hour, gives
but a faint reaction to the test reagent. This method should
be checked up as soon as possible by bacteriological examinations.
An example of this method is given in <a href="#Tab14">Table XIV</a>.</p>

<h3>BACTERIA SURVIVING CHLORINATION</h3>


<p><a name="Sec4_1" id="Sec4_1"></a>A disinfectant is usually described as a substance capable
of destroying bacteria and other micro-organisms, and
an antiseptic as one that restrains or retards their growth
or reproduction. This distinction is entirely arbitrary as the
ability of a substance to kill organisms or merely inhibit
their growth depends upon the concentration employed.</p>

<p>Chlorine and hypochlorites, even in minute doses, exert
a toxic effect that is sufficient to produce death in organisms
but when still smaller concentrations are employed the toxic
effect is transient and the reproductive faculty may be
entirely regained.</p>

<p><a name="Sec4_2" id="Sec4_2"></a>The enumeration of bacteria by means of solid media
depends upon the ability of the organism to reproduce at
such a rate as to produce a visible colony within the period
of incubation and any substance that prevents the growth
of a visible colony is classified as a disinfectant; if on further
incubation the bacterial count approximates that of the
untreated sample the added substance has acted mainly as
an antiseptic. In practice no substance acts entirely as an
antiseptic as the organisms present have varying degrees of
resistance and the less viable ones are killed by doses that
are only antiseptic to the more resistant ones. An example
of an antiseptic effect followed by a mild disinfectant action,
caused by small doses of bleach is shown in <a href="#Tab15">Table XV</a>. In
this experiment the water designated as control was from the
same source as the treated water. In order to make the
bacterial count in this water approximately the same as in the
treated water, the original count was reduced by diluting
the sample with water from the same source, sterilised by
boiling, and afterwards rea&euml;rated with sterile air.</p>

<p><a href="#Tab15">Table XV</a> shows a recovery of the anabolic functions
after treatment with 0.1 p.p.m. of chlorine but since this was
obtained by plating on such a suitable medium as nutrient
gelatine, it is probable that reproduction in water having a

is indicated by the results obtained.</p>

<p><a name="Sec4_3" id="Sec4_3"></a>There is no evidence of any marked difference in the
resistance of ordinary water bacteria to chlorine and these

<p><a name="Sec4_4" id="Sec4_4"></a>In practice no attempt is made, except in special cases,
to destroy the spore-bearing organisms as they have no sanitary
significance and the concentration of chlorine required
for their destruction would cause complaints as to tastes
and odours if the excess of chlorine were not removed. Such
doses are unnecessary and result in waste of material. It
is found that, when the dose is sufficient to eliminate the
<i>B. coli</i> group from 25-50 c.cms. of water, the majority of
the residual bacteria are of the spore-bearing type. Smeeton<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor4_3" id="Fnanchor4_3"></a><a href="#Fn4_3">[3]</a></span>
has investigated the bacteria surviving in the Croton supply
of New York City after treatment with 0.5 p.p.m. of available
chlorine as bleach. <a href="#Tab17">Table XVII</a> gives the results obtained.</p>

<p>The organisms of the <i>B. subtilis</i> group outnumbered all
the others, 66 (62.8 per cent) belonging to this group alone.
This group contained <i>B. subtilis</i>&mdash;Cohn (36 strains), <i>B.
tumescens</i>&mdash;Chester (15 strains) <i>B. ruminatus</i>&mdash;Chester (13
strains), and <i>B. simplex</i>&mdash;Chester 1904, (2 strains). Three
of the four coccus forms were classified as <i>M. luteus</i>. No
intestinal forms were found.</p>

<p><a name="Sec4_5" id="Sec4_5"></a>Clark and De Gage<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor4_4" id="Fnanchor4_4"></a><a href="#Fn4_4">[4]</a></span>
in 1910 directed attention to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fact that the bacterial counts, made at 37&deg; C. on chlorinated
samples, were often much greater than the counts obtained
at room temperature. &#8220;This phenomenon of reversed ratios
between counts at the two temperatures,&#8221; they stated, &#8220;has
been occasionally observed with natural water, but a study
of the record of many thousands of samples shows that the
percentage of such samples is very small, not over 3-5 per
cent.... On the other hand 20-25 per cent. of samples
treated with calcium hypochlorite show higher counts at
body temperature than at room temperature.&#8221; Clark and
De Gage were unable to state the true significance of this
phenomenon but were of the opinion that it was not due to
larger percentages of spore-forming bacteria in the treated
samples. Other observers, on the contrary, have invariably
found the spore-formers to be more resistant to chlorine
and thermophylic in type.</p>

<p>The removal of intestinal forms is, of course, merely a
relative one and when large quantities of treated water are
tested their presence can be detected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>The author, in 1915, made a number of experiments to
ascertain whether the <i>B. coli</i> found after chlorination were
more resistant to chlorine than the original culture. The
strains surviving treatment with comparatively large doses
were fished into lactose broth and subjected to a second
treatment, the process being repeated several times. The
velocity of the germicidal reaction with the strains varied
somewhat, but not always in the same direction, and the
variations were not greater than were found in control experiments
on the original culture. No evidence was obtained
that the surviving strains were in any way more resistant to
chlorine than the original strain; in considering the results it
should be borne in mind that the surviving strains were
cultivated twice on media free from chlorine before again
being subjected to chlorination.</p>

<p>A number of the strains that survived several treatments
were cultivated in lactose broth and the acidity determined
quantitatively. All the cultures produced less acid than the
original culture, and the average was materially less than the
original. These results point to a diminution of the bio-chemical
activity by action of the chlorine.</p>

<p><a name="Sec4_6" id="Sec4_6"></a>A point of perhaps more scientific interest than practical
utility is the relative proportion of the various types of <i>B. coli</i>
found before and after treatment with chlorine. The author,
in 1914, commenced the differentiation of the types by means
of dulcite and saccharose and obtained the results shown in
<a href="#Tab18">Table XVIII</a>. These figures are calculated from several
hundreds of strains.</p>

<p>Although there is a slight difference in the relative proportions
of the types found at Ottawa and Baltimore, both
sets of results show definitely that there is no difference in the
resistance of the various types to chlorination.</p>

<p><a name="Sec4_7" id="Sec4_7"></a><b>Aftergrowths.</b> In <a href="#Tab13">Tables XIII</a> (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>)
and <a href="#Tab15">XV</a> (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>),
it will be noticed that, after the preliminary germicidal
action has subsided, a second phase occurs in which there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a rapid growth of organisms. This is usually known as aftergrowth.
When the contact period between chlorination and
consumption is short, the reaction does not proceed beyond
the first phase, but when the treated water is stored in service
reservoirs the second phase may ensue. At one purification
plant, where the service reservoirs are of large capacity,
the aftergrowths amounted to 20,000 bacteria per c.cm.
although the water left the purification plant with a bacterial
count usually lower than 50 per c.cm.</p>

<p>Regarding the nature of this aftergrowth, there has been
a considerable difference of opinion: some regard it as the
result of the multiplication of a resistant minority of practically
all the species of organisms present in the untreated
water; others, that it is partially due to the organisms being
merely &#8220;slugged&#8221; or &#8220;doped,&#8221; i.e. are in a state of suspended
animation, and afterwards resume their anabolic functions;
whilst others believe that with the correct dosage of chlorine,
only spore-forming organisms escape destruction and that
the aftergrowth is the result of these cells again becoming
vegetative.</p>

<p>The aftergrowths obtained under the usual working conditions
vary according to the dosage of chlorine employed,
and none of the above hypotheses alone provides an adequate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
explanation. When the dosage is small, a small number of
active organisms, in addition to the spore bearers, will escape
destruction, and others will suffer a reduction of reproductive
capacity. The flora of the aftergrowth in this case will only
differ from the original flora by the elimination of a majority
of the organisms that are most susceptible to the action of
chlorine and the weaker members of other species of greater
average resistance. As the dose is increased these factors
become relatively less important until a stage is reached
when only the most resistant cells, the spores, remain. The
resultant aftergrowth must necessarily be almost entirely
composed of spore-bearing organisms. A small number of
the most resistant members of non-sporulating organisms
may also be present but they will, in the majority of instances,
form a very small minority. This is the condition that
usually obtains in practice and it is necessary to consider
whether the aftergrowth may have any sanitary significance.</p>

<p>Concerning the secondary development of <i>B. coli</i>, the usual
index of pollution, there is but little information. H. E.
Jordon<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor4_6" id="Fnanchor4_6"></a><a
href="#Fn4_6">[6]</a></span> reported that, of 201 samples, 21 gave a positive
<i>B. coli</i> reaction immediately after treatment, 39 after standing
for twenty-four hours, and 42 after forty-eight hours.
These increases were confined to the warm months, the cold
months actually showing a decrease. The following figures,
taken from the author&#8217;s routine tests for 1913 and 1914,
show a similar tendency, but an analysis of the results by
months did not show that this was confined to the warm
season. The sequence of the results from left to right, in
the <a href="#Tab19">following Table</a>, is in the same order as the contact
period. Approximately 290 samples were taken at each
sampling point.</p>

<p>At station No. 2 the germicidal action was still proceeding
but at No. 5, representing an outlying section of the
city, the increase in the <i>B. coli</i> content is very apparent.</p>

<p>During 1915 and 1916 the author endeavoured to duplicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
these results under laboratory conditions and entirely failed.
These experiments, which were made with the same materials
as were in use at the city chlorination plant, but in glass containers,
were usually only carried to a forty-eight hours contact,
as this was the extreme limit for the city mains; one,
however, was prolonged to five days. Many experiments
were made under varying conditions, with similar results.
Typical examples are given in <a href="#Tab6">Tables VI</a>, <a href="#Tab8">VIII</a> and <a href="#Tab9">IX</a> on
<a href="#Page_33">pages 33</a> and <a href="#Page_37">37</a>.</p>

<p>In every case there was persistent diminution in the
number of <i>B. coli</i> with increase of contact period. Determination
of the bacterial count on nutrient agar showed
that, in several experiments, the aftergrowth had commenced,
and in some instances there was evidence that the second cycle
was partially complete i.e. the number had reached a maximum
and then commenced to decline. The time required for the
completion of the two cycles, comprising the first reduction
caused by the chlorine, the increase or aftergrowth, and the
final reduction due to lack of suitable food material, is
dependent upon several factors of which the dosage and
temperature are the most important. With a small dosage
the germicidal period is short and the second phase is quickly
reached; with large doses, the second phase is not reached
in forty-eight hours; the higher the temperature the quicker
is the action and the development of the aftergrowth. These
statements refer only to the bacteria capable of development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on nutrient agar. The <i>B. coli</i> group behaved differently
and persistently diminished in every case. If <i>B. typhosus</i>
acts in a similar manner to <i>B. coli</i>, the laboratory experiments
show that aftergrowths are of no sanitary significance and
can safely be ignored, but as the results obtained in practice
are contradictory to the laboratory ones, the matter must be
regarded as <i>sub judice</i> until more definite evidence is available.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that samples of water from
&#8220;dead ends&#8221; of distribution mains show high counts and
much larger quantities of <i>B. coli</i> than the water delivered
to the mains. This is another phase of aftergrowth problem
that often causes complaints and can only be eliminated by
&#8220;blowing off&#8221; the mains frequently or by providing circulation
by connecting up the &#8220;dead ends.&#8221; One extreme case of
this description might be cited. A small service was taken
off the main at the extreme edge of the city to supply a
Musketry School two miles away and was only in use for a
few months in the summer season. This service pipe delivered
water containing <i>B. coli</i> in a considerable percentage of the
10 c.cm. samples and in a few instances in 1 c.cm., although
the water delivered to the city mains never exceeded 2 <i>B. coli</i>
per 100 c.cms. and averaged about one-tenth that quantity.
No epidemiological records of the effect of this water are
available because it was put through a Forbes steriliser before
consumption.</p>

<p>In some instances the rate of development of the organisms
after chlorination is greater than in the same water stored
under similar conditions. This is especially noticeable in
the presence of organic matter and has been ascribed to the
action of the chlorine on the organic matter with the production
of other compounds that are available as food material
for the organisms.</p>

<p>Houston, during the treatment of prefiltered water Lincoln
in 1905, found that although the removal of <i>B. coli</i>
and other organisms growing at 37&deg; C. was satisfactory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
there was almost invariably an increase in the bacteria
growing on gelatine at 20&deg; C. This was ascribed to the action
mentioned above and the chemical results supported this view,
more organic matter being found in the filter effluents
than in the prefiltered water. Rideal&#8217;s experiments with
sewage at Guildford indicate that a similar action may occur
in contact beds. The addition of bleach to the prefiltered
water at Yonkers also resulted in an increased count and in
these instances the aftergrowths are due to a disturbance
of the equilibrium by the action of the chlorine on the zooglea
and other organic matter invariably found in ripe filters.
Similar results can be produced by the addition of chlorinated
water to small experimental sand filters. This is shown by the
results in <a href="#Tab20">Tables XX</a> and <a href="#Tab21">XXI</a>.</p>

It is observable that the effect of small doses was comparatively
small and transient; large doses of bleach reduced
the bacteria very materially but the reduction was not maintained
and the subsequent increase was abnormally rapid.</p>

<h3>COMPLAINTS</h3>


<p><a name="Sec5_1" id="Sec5_1"></a>The complaints that have been made against chlorinated
water since the practice was commenced have been very
diversified in character and can be numbered by the legion
and although some have been justifiable, the great majority
has been unsubstantiated and must be ascribed to auto-suggestion.</p>

<p>Almost every one who has had charge of chlorination
plants has noted the latter phenomenon, for in some instances
complaints have been made following the publication of
the information that chlorination was to be commenced but
antecedent to its actual operation, and in others when for
some reason or another, the chlorination plant has been
temporarily stopped. Similar observations have been made
in laboratory experiments when independent observers have
been requested to detect the chlorinated waters from an equal
number of treated and untreated waters. Such observers
are wrong in the majority of the waters which they designate
as treated ones if the dosage is not in excess of that required
for satisfactory purification.</p>

<p>One amusing example of auto-suggestion was experienced
by the author some years ago. During a ceremonial visit to
the waterworks, the Mayor and several civic representatives
happened to visit a hypochlorite plant that was built on a
pier over the river and which had no ostensible connection
with the city mains. One of the party expressed a desire
for a drink of good river water without any hypochlorite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in it and was served with water from the plant supply by an
assistant engineer of the waterworks department. The
water was consumed by all with great relish and as it was
being finished, the writer entered the plant and was invited
to join them in the enjoyment of this &#8220;dopeless&#8221; water;
on asking where it had been obtained he was astonished to
hear that it was from a tap which was supplied with the
ordinary chlorinated water of the city.</p>

<p>On many occasions, complaints are justifiable and should
be carefully investigated instead of, as is often the case,
being attributed to auto-suggestion. The time and energy
that are often devoted to endeavouring to persuade water
consumers that their complaints are without foundation,
can better be utilised in so improving the chlorination process
as to eliminate tastes and odours. All complaints should
be carefully investigated and a record kept for future reference,
for the cause, although not manifest at the time, may be discovered
later. The records then provide valuable corroborative
evidence.</p>

<p>The nature of the complaints against chlorinated water
is very diversified and includes imparting foreign tastes
and odours, causing colic, killing fish and birds, the extraction
of abnormal amounts of tannin from tea, the destruction of
plants and flowers, the corrosion of water pipes, and that
horses and other animals refuse to drink it.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_2" id="Sec5_2"></a><i>Tastes and Odours.</i> When an excess of hypochlorite or
liquid chlorine is added to a water it imparts a sharp pungent
odour and acid taste, characteristic of chlorine, that render
it offensive to the nose and palate. In some instances the
presence of chlorine compounds is not obtrusive when the
temperature of the water is low but becomes so when the
temperature is raised. It is especially observable when
the faucets of hot water services are first opened and the
chlorine is carried off as a vapour by the other gases liberated
by the reduction in pressure. For this reason the complaints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
regarding hot water are relatively more numerous and sometimes
constitute the whole of the complaints. In cold water
containing appreciable quantities of mineral salts the hypochlorites
and hypochlorous acid might not be entirely dissociated;
they may become more hydrolysed with an increase
in temperature and finally broken down under the influence
of the carbonic acid liberated from the bicarbonates by heat.</p>

<p>Chlorine also forms chlorinated organic compounds by
action on the organic matter present in water and some of the
objectionable tastes and odours of chlorinated waters have
been attributed to this agency. Some observers have stated
that chloramines were amongst the chloro-organo compounds
produced but the author&#8217;s experience with the Ottawa supply
has demonstrated that simple chloramine (NH<span class="denom">2</span>Cl) can be
successfully employed for water treatment without causing
complaints. It was suggested on page 28 that some of the
higher chloro-amines might be the cause of some complaints
but at present there is no definite information regarding the
formation of these compounds in water and all such hypotheses
are little more than conjectures. Letton<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor5_1"
id="Fnanchor5_1"></a><a href="#Fn5_1">[1]</a></span> has reported
that at Trenton, in 1911, when the water of the Delaware
River was first treated, the dosage was as high as 1.2 p.p.m.
of available chlorine and although chemical tests showed the
absence of free chlorine, the water had an extremely disagreeable
taste which was especially noticeable in the hot
water. The conclusion was reached that &#8220;the taste and
odour were not those of chlorine, but were due to some complex
chemical change brought about by the action of the
chlorine on the organic matter present in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waters that require the most accurate adjustment
of chlorine dosage, if complaints are to be avoided, are those
containing very small amounts of organic matter. The margin
between the dosage required for the attainment of a satisfactory
degree of bacteriological purity and that which may
cause complaints is usually very small, often less than 25<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
per cent, with the waters of the Great Lakes and many filter
effluents. On the other hand, coloured waters containing
large amounts of organic matter can be treated with an
excess of chlorine without causing tastes and odours. The
author found that the addition of 1.5 p.p.m. of available
chlorine to the Ottawa River water did not cause complaints
although only 0.8 to 0.9 p.p.m. were usually required for
satisfactory purification. Harrington of Montreal has had a
similar experience with this water.</p>

<p>The presence of traces of foreign substances in water
sometimes produces chlorinated derivatives having repugnant
tastes and odours. Creosote and tar oils have caused an
odour somewhat resembling that of iodoform and industrial
wastes have also produced complaints.</p>

<p>The substitution of chlorine gas (liquid chlorine) for
bleach solutions has apparently eliminated tastes and odours
in some cases but this may be due to a more perfect control
over the dosage rather than to any property of the bleach
<i>per se</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_3" id="Sec5_3"></a>In some instances the sludge from bleach plants has
caused complaints by producing an excessive concentration
of chlorine during the period of its discharge. This occurred
in Ottawa on several occasions before it was discovered and
corrected. When the sludge in the storage tanks reached
the discharge valve it was customary to wash out the tank
and discharge the sludge into the river. The operators
opened the wash out valves to the full extent and the sludge
and liquor were discharged into the river about 70 feet away
from the inlet to the sedimentation basin and on the downstream
side of it. A portion of the hypochlorite was almost
invariably carried into the basin and increased the dosage.
This condition was remedied by carrying the sludge drain
farther down stream and insisting upon the sludge being discharged
at a slower rate.</p>

<p>Kienle<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn5_2">[2]</a></span>
has reported similar occurrences at Chicago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The hypochlorite was applied at the intake cribs situated a
considerable distance off shore. The direction of the wind
often necessitated holding the sludge for a considerable
length of time but occasionally it was found impossible to
await favourable conditions with the result that the wind
and wave action carried a portion of the sludge back into the
crib and down into the shaft and tunnel.</p>

<p>The temperature of the water at the time of treatment is
another factor bearing on the production of tastes and odours.
When the temperature is low, water absorbs relatively less
chlorine (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Diag2">Diagram No. II</a>, <a href="#Page_38">page 38</a>) in the same period
of time with the consequence that, if the dosage is kept constant,
more chlorine is present in the free condition. At
Milwaukee (Kienle)<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn5_2">[2]</a></span>
with a dosage of 0.24 p.p.m. of available
chlorine (as bleach) no complaints were received during the
spring, summer, and autumn seasons but when the temperature
reached 40&deg; F., they were compelled to reduce the chlorine
to 0.12 p.p.m. in order to prevent objectionable tastes and
odours in the tap waters.</p>

<p>Abnormal conditions such as freshets, and storms, sometimes
cause complaints regarding tastes and odours. Adams<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor5_3"
id="Fnanchor5_3"></a><a href="#Fn5_3">[3]</a></span>
found that the complaints in Toronto usually accompanied
a change in the direction of the wind, a sustained east wind
being the one most productive of trouble. The exact cause
for this could not be ascertained but it was usually found
that there was an accompanying increase in the number of
microscopical organisms (plankton) present in the raw water.</p>

<p>Freshets usually increase the bacterial contamination and
necessitate an increased dosage which may cause complaints.</p>

<p>Complaints as to tastes and odours can be best avoided
by ensuring regularity of dosage, perfect admixture, and
storage of the treated water for a reasonable period. These
factors are discussed in detail elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_4" id="Sec5_4"></a><i>Colic.</i> Although claims have been made that the consumption
of chlorinated water has produced &#8220;colic&#8221; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
corroborative evidence has been adduced and the symptoms
have probably been due to some other cause. Dilute solutions
of chlorine have been used as intestinal antiseptics in
the treatment of typhoid fever without producing irritation
of the mucous lining and the usual dose for this treatment
is one grain of chlorine. Before taking a <i>medicinal</i> dose
of chlorine 140 gallons of water containing 0.1 p.p.m. would
have to be consumed, a quantity greater than is ordinarily
drunk in a year.</p>

<p>Chlorine and hypochlorites are destructive and irritant
to skin and it is possible that hot chlorinated water has, in
some instances, a similar effect.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that the addition of minute traces of
bleach or chlorine to water should cause it to extract abnormal
amounts of tannin from tea but it is possible that free chlorine,
when present, acts upon the tea extractives and produces
compounds having obnoxious tastes and odours. Tannin
to the ordinary tea drinker represents the disagreeable portion
of the tea and an obnoxious taste in tea brewed with
chlorinated water would consequently be ascribed to the
extraction of abnormal quantities of tannin.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_5" id="Sec5_5"></a>Almost all waterworks departments using chlorination
have received complaints to the effect that the water had
killed fish and small birds. There is usually no evidence
that the loss was due to chlorinated water but it is generally
impossible to convince the owners that the process of water
treatment was not the cause. Many continuous physiological
tests have been made of the effect of chlorinated water
on small fish and have shown that the concentration used in
water treatment is without effect. The author kept a tank
of minnows in one of the pumping stations for months without
loss although the tank was continuously supplied with water
that had been treated but a few seconds previously. The bleach
solution was discharged into the suction of the pumps and the
water for the fish test was taken from the discharge header.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>It has been found on many occasions that fish are extremely
susceptible to chlorine and hypochlorites. This knowledge
has been sometimes used for such nefarious purposes as fish
poaching, a few pounds of bleach in a small stream being a
simple and most effective method of killing all the fish
which are then carried down stream into a convenient net.
Chlorinated sewage effluents have also been known to
destroy the fish life of the stream into which they were
discharged.</p>

<p>The opinion of fish culturists as to the action of chlorinated
waters upon fish eggs in hatcheries is almost unanimously
to the effect that it is a destructive one. Fish eggs
are extremely sensitive to chlorine and hypochlorous acid
and very few will survive in a water containing 0.1 p.p.m.
of free chlorine. The Department of Fisheries of the
Dominion of Canada has informed the author that free
chlorine in the water had a marked adverse effect on the
hatching of the eggs of Atlantic salmon, Great Lake trout,
pickerel, and whitefish, but no effect was noticed when free
chlorine was absent. The Department has, however, decided
to remove all the hatcheries to localities where water that
does not require chlorination can be obtained.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_6" id="Sec5_6"></a>The effect of chlorinated water upon seeds, plants, and
flowers has been investigated by the Dominion Department
of Agriculture and Dr. Gussow (Dominion Botanist) and
Dr. Shutt (Agricultural Chemist) who were in charge of the
work, have reported that water treated with hypochlorite
caused no apparent injury to carnations and hybrid roses.
Six varieties of wheat seed, after soaking in freshly prepared
hypochlorite solutions (0.05 to 10 parts per million of available
chlorine) were all sown on the same day. Germination
was found to be uniform throughout and no effect of the
chlorine was observed either as regards the rate of germination
or the development of the young plants. Experiments
on barley and oats produced similar results. Radishes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
turnips, cucumbers, and beans also showed no retardation
in development after treatment with chlorinated water.</p>

<p>These experiments were conducted with solutions of bleach
in distilled water, but identical results were obtained in a
later series when the treated city supply (Ottawa) was used.</p>

<p>The results proved conclusively that statements alleging
damage to plants, flowers, and seeds by the hypochlorite
treatment of water are unfounded and do not merit the
slightest consideration.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_7" id="Sec5_7"></a><i>Corrosion of Pipes.</i> Chlorinated water, it has been
alleged on many occasions, causes rapid corrosion of galvanised
iron water services and especially of the water tubes of boilers,
water heaters, etc. When bleach is used for water treatment,
a slight increase in the hardness is produced but as
this is mostly due to calcium chloride, there is no corresponding
increase in the salts that form a protective coating. The
presence of traces of calcium chloride and chloro-organic
compounds might tend to increase the corrosive properties
of a water but this increase is probably so small as to be
negligible.</p>

<p>If pipe corrosion is considered by the carbonic acid hypothesis,
the use of bleach should tend to reduce it because
bleach contains an excess of base that combines with a portion
of the free carbonic acid. The results of routine tests
for free carbonic acid made on the raw and treated waters
at Ottawa are as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>These figures shown that the hypochlorite treatment produced
a small but definite decrease in the carbonic acid content
and should, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, tend to reduce and not increase
corrosion.</p>

<p>If the corrosion of pipes is considered according to the
electrolytic theory, a slight increase, due to an increased
electrical conductivity, might be anticipated. The effect of
the addition of hypochlorite upon the electrical conductivity
of distilled water and the Ottawa River water is shown in
<a href="#Diag6">Diagram VI</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag6" id="Diag6"></a>
<p class="caption">DIAGRAM VI</p>
<img src="images/diag006.png" alt="Effect of Calcium Hypochlorite on Electrical Conductivity" width="479" height="500" /></div>

<p>With the concentrations of hypochlorite ordinarily used in
water treatment it is inconceivable that the slight increase
in the electrical conductivity has any practical significance
at low temperatures. The conductivity increases rapidly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
however, with increase of temperature and any increment
due to chlorination might produce a slight appreciable effect
at temperatures approaching the boiling-point of water.</p>

<p>Liquid chlorine does not increase the conductivity to
the same extent as an equivalent quantity of hypochlorite
but it increases the carbonic acid content in proportion to
the dosage used.</p>

<p>The author investigated the action of hypochlorite on
galvanised pipes in 1914 and was unable to detect any definite
corrosion with normal concentrations of chlorine. The experiments
were made with 2-inch pipes and an examination of
the first consignment received showed that, although the
galvanising on the outside was perfect, the inner coat was very
inferior: in some parts there was an excess of zinc that broke
away on scraping whilst in others the iron pipe was bare.</p>

<p>A committee of the Pittsburg Board of Trade, appointed
to investigate complaints as to pipe corrosion, reported in
1917 that they were largely due to inferior qualities of pipes
and not to the method of water purification employed (slow
sand filtration and chlorination).</p>

<p>The effect of chlorination on the <i>plumbo-solvency</i> of water
was investigated in 1904 by Houston who found that chlorine,
as chloros, in amounts between one and ten parts per million,
did not appreciably increase the plumbo-solvent action of
either unfiltered or filtered water. Similar results were
obtained by the author with the Toronto supply: raw lake
water, filtered water, and water treated with 0.25 and 0.50
p.p.m. of chlorine, all dissolved the same quantity of lead in
twenty-four hours. The amount in each case was too small
to be of any significance.</p>

<h3>BLEACH TREATMENT</h3>


<p>The treatment of water with bleach alone has been largely
supplanted by the liquid chlorine process but the following
details will be of use on meeting conditions for which liquid
chlorine cannot be used and also for the preparation of the
hypochlorite solution required in the chloramine process.</p>

<p>The essential features of a bleach installation are the
solution or mixing tanks, storage tanks, piping system, discharge
orifice or weir, and sludge drain.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_1" id="Sec6_1"></a>Bleach is usually sent out by the manufacturers in sheet
steel drums, 39 inches high and 29<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter, which
contain about 14 cu. ft. of bleach and weigh approximately
750 pounds gross and 690 pounds net. It can be most
economically purchased in car lots and if the consumption
warrants this procedure storage should be provided for about
70 drums or rather more than one car load. According to
Hooker<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_1" id="Fnanchor6_1"></a><a
href="#Fn6_1">[1]</a></span> bleach loses 1 per cent of available chlorine per
month in hot seasons and 0.3 per cent in cold ones so that it
is advisable to carry as little stock as possible during hot
weather. Hot weather also causes a further loss by accelerating
the action of the bleach on the drum which rapidly
disintegrates and cannot be handled. Bleach can often be
purchased more cheaply in hot weather but such a policy is a
short sighted one unless it is required for immediate use.</p>

<p>The general design of a hypochlorite plant is largely determined
by the capacity but in all cases an effort should be made
to avoid complicated details which may appear advantageous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in the drafting office but do not stand up in actual practice.
Many metals rapidly develop a protective coating on immersion
in bleach solution but if this is removed by friction,
rapid erosion ensues; bearing metallic surfaces should be
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_2" id="Sec6_2"></a><i>Mixing Tanks.</i> All tanks, whether mixing or storage,
should be constructed of concrete and painted with two
coats of asphalt. Experience has shown that wooden tanks
are not suitable. The author has used pine, oak, and cypress
tanks but all were rapidly leached by the hypochlorite and
ultimately had to be lined with concrete.</p>

<p>There is a considerable variation in the concentration of
bleach solution made in mixing tanks at various works.
Some operators use about one gallon of water per pound of
bleach and mix the two to a cream by wooden paddles,
revolving on a central axis, for 1-2 hours; the paddles are
then stopped and the cream run out into the storage tanks
and diluted to the required strength by passing water through
the mixing tank. There are two objections to this method:
(1) the addition of small quantities of water to bleach tends to
gelatinisation which may protect lumps from the further
action of water and (2) a stratification of the solution occurs
in the storage tank unless agitation is used. Gelatinisation
causes loss of available chlorine and stratification causes
irregular dosage unless corrected by agitation, which necessitates
power. Other operators mix the bleach and water to
the final concentration in the mixing tank and discharge the
contents into the storage tank, the intermittent process being
repeated until the storage tank is full. Gelatinisation is
avoided by using a low original concentration and as all
batches are of equal density no stratification is produced.</p>

<p>At Ottawa the bleach is crushed and, after weighing,
dumped into a circular concrete tank provided with a hinged
wooden lid. The stirring arrangement consists of a bronze
shaft on which an aluminium impeller is fixed which revolves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in an iron tube set slightly above the bottom of the tank
(see <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>). After the requisite amount of water has been
added the motor connected to the bronze shaft is started
and the mixture pumped for 15-20 minutes; without waiting
for the sludge to settle the contents are discharged into the
storage tank and the operation repeated until the tank is
full. The piping between the mixing and storage tanks is of
galvanised iron of generous dimension so as to compensate
for incrustation. The pipes are straight and are provided
with crosses at every change of direction to enable excessive
incrustation to be removed. The valves should be made of
hard rubber or special bronze; if brass valves are used they
will probably require renewing every twelve months.</p>

<p>The concentration of solution necessarily depends upon
local conditions but it is usually advisable to keep it below
2.5 per cent of bleach, which is equivalent to 0.85 per cent
of available chlorine.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_3" id="Sec6_3"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[75]</a></span><i>Storage Tanks.</i> These should be built of reinforced concrete
and painted inside with asphalt, which should be periodically
renewed to prevent the solution seeping through to the
reinforcement. At least two tanks should be provided
so that one may be filled and allowed to settle before being
put in operation. The hypochlorite discharge pipe is usually
6-9 inches from the bottom to permit the collection of sludge,
which is run off when it reaches the elevation of the hypochlorite
discharge. The sludge drain, which opens into the
bottom of the tank, is usually a 4- or 6-inch cast-iron pipe,
with suitable gate valve, which discharges into a common
drain made of clay pipe.</p>

<p>The storage tanks should be provided with either glass
gauges or float indicators to enable the orifice discharge
to be checked up at periodical intervals.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_4" id="Sec6_4"></a><i>Regulation of Dosage.</i> The discharge of the hypochlorite
solution is usually regulated either by maintaining a constant
head on an orifice of variable dimension or by varying the
head on an orifice of fixed dimension. The weir principle
may also be used but it is not so well adapted for hypochlorite
as for other chemicals.</p>

<p>In the constant head method, the head is maintained by a
bronze valve connected to a float made of glass or tinned
copper. In many cases the orifice is a rectangular slot in a
brass plate and is adjusted by means of a brass slide operated
by a micrometer screw. Brass plates are not very suitable
as they become corroded and so reduce the size of the orifice;
if the incrustation is removed the orifice will discharge more
than the calibration indicates. Needle valves are unsuitable
for similar reasons.</p>

<p>An example of an orifice feed box of the constant head
type is shown in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>. A vertically arranged hard-rubber
pipe passes though a hard rubber stuffing box in the bottom
of the tank and has one or more orifices near its upper end.
The area of the submerged portions of the orifices is controlled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by the hand wheel which is connected with the threaded stem
of the pipe. The stem has sixteen threads per inch, and one
revolution of the wheel will submerge the orifices one-sixteenth
of an inch. The extent to which the orifices are submerged
is indicated on the dial fixed to the side of
the tank.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="images/fig002.jpg" alt="Dosage Tank" width="500" height="374" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Dosage Tank.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows the regulating mechanism
of another apparatus of the constant head
type. The orifice consists of a circular
slot in a hard rubber disc and is regulated
by means of a hand wheel which operates
a hard rubber slide.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><img src="images/fig003.png" alt="Orifice Controlling Device"

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Orifice<br />Controlling Device.</p></div>

<p>The general arrangement of one of the
variable head types is shown in <a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>. A
constant head is maintained on the valve
<i>V</i> by a float and cock operating in a lead- or
porcelain-lined tank. The circular
tapered orifice <i>O</i>, cut in glass, is situated
in the flanged end of the iron casting <i>C</i> and
the head, indicated on the gauge glass, is
regulated by valve <i>V</i>. This arrangement
is simple and reasonably accurate. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
orifice may show slight incrustation after being in service
for some time but it can be easily cleaned by means of a
test-tube brush or a small swab moistened with acid; a
wire or rod tends to break the edge of the conical orifice
and should not be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><img src="images/fig004.png" alt="Variable Head Dosage Box" width="500" height="223" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Variable Head Dosage Box.</p></div>

<p>The volume of solution discharged by orifices of various
dimensions is shown in <a href="#Diag15">Diagram XV</a>, <a href="#Page_149">page 149</a>. <a href="#Diag16">Diagram
XVI</a>, <a href="#Page_149">page 149</a>, facilitates the calculation of the number of
pounds of bleach required for any dosage.</p>

<p>The solution discharged from the orifice box is carried
to the point of application either in galvanised iron pipes of
generous dimension or in rubber hose. Pumps may be used
for raising the solution to a higher elevation but unless
special material is used in their construction they corrode
rapidly and cannot be kept in service. Whenever possible,
a water injector should be used as it does not corrode and
assists in maintaining the delivery pipes free from sludge.
All delivery pipes should be duplicated and blown out regularly
by water under pressure; they should also be protected from
frost.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the hypochlorite dosage can be automatically
regulated in plants where the flow of the water to
be treated is measured by a Venturi meter or other suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
appliance. Various devices have been suggested and used
but, in general, they are not so successful as automatic regulators
for liquid chlorine on account of the presence of sludge
particles which tend to diminish the area of the orifice.</p>

<p>For small plants, barrels have often been used as solution
and storage vessels with, in some instances, fairly successful
results. The bleach process, however, cannot be recommended
for small installations because the chemical control necessary
for successful operation is usually not available. One drum
of bleach may suffice for several months operation and as the
powder gradually loses strength, the dosage constantly diminishes
and may jeopardise the safety of the supply. Liquid
chlorine machines are much more suitable than hypochlorite
installations for supplies having no chemical control.</p>

<p>Bleach is being very extensively used for the sterilisation
of the water used by the allied troops in France. The
water supplies on the British front are all more or less subject
to pollution and it is consequently necessary, to ensure
adequate protection, to chlorinate all supplies with bleach.
Other forms of chlorine have been tried but have not proved
successful near the firing lines. The details of the technique
employed cannot be given but it may be stated that the concentration
of chlorine employed is always more than sufficient
and that residual tastes and odours are regarded as secondary
considerations. Treated water is always tested by the starch-iodide
method and a bacteriological examination is frequently
made by mobile laboratories.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_5" id="Sec6_5"></a><b>Control of Hypochlorite Plants.</b> If efficient operation and
regular dosage is to be obtained, it is necessary that hypochlorite
plants should be controlled by a trained chemist.
Good results are occasionally obtained without such control
but in every plant circumstances arise at some period or
another which only a chemist is qualified to deal with.</p>

<p>The points that require consideration are (1) the composition
of the bleach; (2) concentration of available chlorine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in the prepared solutions; and (3) chemical tests for free
chlorine in the treated water.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_6" id="Sec6_6"></a>(1) <i>Composition of Bleach.</i> Each drum of bleach should be
sampled and analysed before use. The sample is obtained
by cutting out the head of the drum and removing a vertical
section by means of a special sampling tube or a piece of half-inch
iron pipe which is forced to the bottom of the drum
with a boring motion and then removed; the core is then
forced out by means of a rod, mixed, and quartered down to
the required size.</p>

<p>For analysis weigh out 5 grms. on a balance sensitive
to 0.01 grm. and grind in a mortar with 50-70 c.cms. of water;
wash into a 250 c.cm. flask and make the volume up to 250
c.cms.; shake. After allowing the sludge to settle remove
10 c.cms. by means of a pipette and titrate by one of the
following methods:</p>

<p><i>Bunsen&#8217;s Method.</i> Add 10 c.cms. of a 5 per cent solution
of potassium iodide and 0.5 c.cm. glacial acetic acid and
titrate with sodium thiosulphate (24.8 grms. of the C.P.
crystalline salt and 1 c.cm. of chloroform per litre) using a
starch solution as indicator. Each cubic centimetre of thiosulphate
used = 1.755 per cent of available chlorine (1 c.cm.
N/10 sodium thiosulphate = 0.00355 grm. available chlorine).</p>

<p><i>Penot&#8217;s Method.</i> Dilute the hypochlorite solution with
15 c.cms. of water and titrate with a solution of N/10 sodium
arsenite using starch-iodide paper as an external indicator.
Each c.cm. of solution used = 1.755 per cent of available
chlorine (1 c.cm. = 0.00355 grm. available chlorine). The
use of an external indicator makes this process a slow one
and to overcome this objection Mohr proposed the addition
of an excess of sodium arsenite solution and then titrating
with N/10 iodine solution after adding a few drops of starch
solution.</p>

<p>Griffen and Hedallen<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_2" id="Fnanchor6_2"></a><a
href="#Fn6_2">[2]</a></span> compared these three methods
and found that Penot&#8217;s method and Mohr&#8217;s modification of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that method gave results which were 0.6 per cent lower than
those obtained by Bunsen&#8217;s method.</p>

<p>For a separate estimation of the chlorine present as
chloride, chlorate, and hypochlorite the method given in
Sutton&#8217;s Volumetric Analysis, 10th edition, page 178, should
be followed.</p>

<p><i>Storage Liquor.</i> This is tested by any of the above
methods. It has been proposed to determine the strength
of the bleach solution by the use of a hydrometer but the
results are not sufficiently accurate and the method cannot be
recommended.</p>

<p>If bleach is properly broken up and thoroughly agitated
in the mixing tank at least 95 per cent of the available chlorine
should be extracted. The efficiency of the extraction process
is checked by comparing the tests of the storage liquor with
those of the dry bleach and each batch of liquor should be
tested daily. It is sometimes advisable to take two samples
from each tank, one soon after a tank has been put into
operation, and a second sample at the end of the run. Considerable
differences are occasionally found between these
samples and are due, either to inadequate agitation of the
liquor in the storage tank, or inefficient mixing in the mixing
tank. If the results are irregular the former is the more
probable cause but if the second sample is invariably stronger
the mixing tank operations should be investigated. The
increased concentration of the second sample is due to unextracted
bleach passing out of the mixing tank and gradually
becoming leached as the tank contents are run off. If the
bleach is lumpy and is not subsequently broken up, losses
are almost inevitable.</p>

<p>Hale<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_3" id="Fnanchor6_3"></a><a href="#Fn6_3">[3]</a></span>
found that during the period when the New York
City supply was being treated with bleach it was necessary
to constantly check the operations of the labourers by frequent
samples. &#8220;During one week about 95 per cent of the chlorine
added was actually applied, the second week it dropped to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
85 per cent. and the third week to 75 per cent. Whenever a
poor run is called to the attention of the labourers, results
improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>By taking two samples daily from each tank discharged
the author has been able to obtain an average annual efficiency
on the Ottawa plant of 94 per cent., i.e. the solutions contained
94 per cent. of the available chlorine contained in the bleach.
In making such checks it is necessary to keep a careful account
of the stock of bleach to prevent labourers adding a few extra
pounds of bleach to compensate for losses.</p>

<p>Sludge forms an appreciable but unavoidable source of
loss of material. When the sludge reaches the outlet of the
hypochlorite pipe the sludge must be run to waste; otherwise
it will pass over and tend to choke the dosage control apparatus.
If the sludge is run into the same body of water that
forms the source of supply, it must be discharged very slowly
to prevent a possibility of over dosage and damage to fish
life. With proper control, sludge losses can easily be kept
under 2 per cent. and often under 1 per cent.</p>

<p>The greatest source of unavoidable loss in hypochlorite
plants is from deterioration of the bleach during storage;
in warm climates this loss may exceed 10 per cent. In
Ottawa where high temperatures are only experienced during
the summer months the loss from this cause has averaged
from 7-8 per cent. on the bleach stored during that period.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_7" id="Sec6_7"></a><i>Detection and Estimation of Free Chlorine.</i> The oldest
and probably the best known test for free chlorine in water
is the Wagner test, made by adding a few drops of potassium
iodide and starch; the presence of chlorine is indicated by a
deep rich blue colouration that is proportional in intensity
to the quantity of chlorine present. When this test is used
as a colorimetric method for the estimation of chlorine several
difficulties are encountered; the intensity of the colour produced
by the majority of treated waters gradually diminishes
and the loss is usually more rapid than in the standards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
made up with distilled water; a different result is obtained
if the solutions are acidified and the results vary with different
acids, acetic acid yielding a much lower result than a
mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid; in the presence of
acid the colouration usually intensifies on standing, whereas
the standard intensifies but little. The difference caused by
the addition of acid is imperfectly understood but it is obvious
that the chlorine set free by the acid cannot be present in
the &#8220;free&#8221; state; it is probably in a semi-labile condition
loosely attached to organic compounds. Whether this semi-labile
chlorine is available for germicidal action is at present
not definitely known but it has been noted by several observers
that the germicidal action proceeds after the &#8220;free&#8221; chlorine
reaction has disappeared.</p>

<p>The method used by the author for the estimation of
free chlorine is as follows: place 500 c.cms. of the sample
in a stoppered bottle, add 1 c.cm. of 5 per cent KI solution,
2 drops of conc. HCl and 1 c.cm. of starch solution and titrate
with N/1000 sodium thiosulphate until colourless. The difficulty
introduced by the opalescence of the liquid is overcome
by pouring portions of the liquid into two Nessler tubes
and adding a drop of thiosulphate solution to one and noting
if any reduction of colour occurs on shaking; if the intensity
of the colour is diminished, the contents of both tubes are
poured back into the bottle and titrated until no further
colour removal, as shown by the tubes, can be obtained.
One c.cm. of N/1000 sodium thiosulphate = 0.07 p.p.m. of
available chlorine when 500 c.cms. of water are used.</p>

<p>Adams<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_4" id="Fnanchor6_4"></a><a href="#Fn6_4">[4]</a></span>
has employed the colorimetric method of estimating
the colour obtained after the addition of dilute H<span class="denom">2</span>SO<span class="denom">4</span>, KI,
and starch but used standard solutions of dyes for comparison.
The standards were prepared from mixtures of Brilliant
Mill Green &#8220;S&#8221; and Cardinal Red &#8220;J&#8221; and were made
up weekly.</p>

<p>Phelps found that ortho-tolidine in acetic acid solution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
produced an intense yellow colouration with free chlorine
and suggested the use of this reagent as a qualitative test
for chlorine. Ellms and Hauser<span class="fnanchor"><a
href="#Fn6_5">[5]</a></span> developed this process
into a quantitative one and substituted hydrochloric acid
for acetic acid as a solvent. One c.cm. of the reagent (1 gram
of pure <i>o</i>-tolidine dissolved in 1 litre of 10 per cent of hydrochloric
acid) is added to 100 c.cms. of the sample in a Nessler
tube and the colour compared after five minutes with permanent
standards made up with mixtures of potassium
bichromate and copper sulphate. This method was adopted
as the official standard method of the American Public Health
Association; the details are given in the Appendix (<a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>).</p>

<p>The author has found that this method gives excellent
results except for coloured waters. The colouring matter
in many waters diminishes in intensity on the addition of
acids and is somewhat similar in tint to that produced by
addition of <i>o</i>-tolidine. If the reaction is used qualitatively
on coloured treated water and a comparison made with the
untreated sample, a negative result, due to the reduction in
colour produced by the acid being greater than the increase
caused by the reagent, might be obtained when traces of free
chlorine are present. Similar difficulties are encountered
when quantitative comparisons are made against permanent
standards.</p>

<p>Benzidine (Wallis<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_6" id="Fnanchor6_6"></a><a href="#Fn6_6">[6]</a></span>)
has also been suggested for the
detection of free chlorine. On adding this reagent a blue
colouration is produced but on stirring it rapidly changes to a
bright yellow which is proportional in intensity to the amount
of free chlorine present. Ellms and Hauser<span class="fnanchor"><a
href="#Fn6_5">[5]</a></span> investigated
benzidine in 1913 and found it to be inferior to <i>o</i>-tolidine as
a test reagent for free chlorine.</p>

<p>LeRoy<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_7" id="Fnanchor6_7"></a><a
href="#Fn6_7">[7]</a></span> has proposed the use of hexamethyltri<i>para</i>-aminotriphenylmethane
for detecting and estimating free
chlorine. On the addition of a hydrochloric acid solution
of this compound to a sample containing free chlorine a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
violet colouration is produced that can be matched in the usual
way with standards. It is stated that 0.03 p.p.m. of free
chlorine gives a distinct colouration and that the reagent
reacts very slowly with nitrites and is quite unaffected by
hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p>The starch-iodide and <i>o</i>-tolidine reactions are affected
by oxidising agents or reducible substances; nitrites and
ferric salts are the compounds that are most likely to interfere
and Ellms and Hauser<span class="fnanchor"><a
href="#Fn6_5">[5]</a></span> have found that these bodies do
not affect the <i>o</i>-tolidine reaction to the same extent as the
starch-iodide reaction. Very small quantities of nitrites (0.03
p.p.m. of N) and ferric salts (0.2 p.p.m. Fe) give a blue
colouration with the starch-iodide reagent and for this reason
it is always advisable, whenever possible, to make a control
test on the untreated water. Nitrites are oxidised by free
chlorine and consequently do not interfere with the estimation
of it by the thiosulphate method; the influence of ferric
salts can be overcome by substituting 3 c.cms. of 25 per cent
phosphoric acid for hydrochloric acid (Winkler<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_8" id="Fnanchor6_8"></a><a
href="#Fn6_8">[8]</a></span>).</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_8" id="Sec6_8"></a>An electrical instrument called a &#8220;chlorometer&#8221; has been
devised by E. K. Rideal and Evans<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_9" id="Fnanchor6_9"></a><a
href="#Fn6_9">[9]</a></span> for the estimation of
free chlorine. The diagrammatic sketch, reproduced in <a href="#Fig5">Fig.
5</a>, shows the general construction of the apparatus. When
water containing no free chlorine passes through the copper
tube, hydrogen is liberated on the platinum rod by the electrolytic
solution pressure of the copper and an electric current
is generated; a polarizing action follows and the flow of
current ceases. When free chlorine is present it combines
with the hydrogen as produced and so enables more copper
to dissolve and produces a permanent flow of current. The
current produced is a function of the depolarizing action, i.e.
of the free chlorine, and is indicated by the current meter
which is graduated in parts per million of available chlorine.
The usual range of instrument is 5 p.p.m. and each division
of the scale is equal to one-tenth of one part per million.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Only strong oxidisers, such as chlorine, ozone, and permanganates,
which have a great affinity for hydrogen,
are able to produce a permanent current; ferric chloride
and other weak oxidisers do not affect the indicator.</p>


<h3><a name="Sec6_9" id="Sec6_9"></a><span class="smcap">Costs</span></h3>

<p><i>Cost of Construction.</i> According to the replies received
by the Committee on Water Supplies of the American Public
Health Association<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_10" id="Fnanchor6_10"></a><a
href="#Fn6_10">[10]</a></span> the total cost of equipment for disinfection
varies widely and bears no apparent relation to the
capacity of the equipment. This is due to the temporary
nature of the plants erected in many cities and the necessity
of erecting expensive structures in others. The cost of construction
varies also in different localities. The cost of equipping
hypochlorite plants with standard concrete tanks and
dosage regulators would be more uniform and for capacities
between 10 and 50 million gallons per day would approximate
$15 to $50 per million gallons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span><i>The operating cost</i> of bleach plants shows similar wide
variations. In some cases the labour required for mixing
and supervision can be obtained without extra cost whilst
in others the labour charge exceeds the cost of hypochlorite.</p>

<p>The price of bleach has shown violent fluctuations during
the last three years (see <a href="#Diag9">Diagram IX</a>, <a href="#Page_125">page 125</a>) but is now
(1918) comparatively steady at $2.25 to $2.75 per 100 pounds.
Assuming that 33.3 per cent of available chlorine can be
extracted, each pound of chlorine costs 6.75-7.25 cents as
compared with 15-25 cents for liquid chlorine. The fixed
charges on the capital expenditures together with the labour
and incidental charges almost invariably make the total
cost of operation of a straight bleach plant higher than that
of a liquid chlorine plant. The tendency during the last
four years has been to substitute liquid chlorine for hypochlorite
and the majority of the plants are now of the former
type.</p>


<h3><a name="Sec6_10" id="Sec6_10"></a>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Antichlors</span>&#8221;</h3>

<p>Substances used for the removal of excess chlorine are
usually known as &#8220;antichlors&#8221; and those that have been
most frequently employed are sodium bisulphite, NaHSO<span class="denom">3</span>,
and sodium thiosulphate Na<span class="denom">2</span>S<span class="denom">2</span>O<span class="denom">3</span>. The reactions with
chlorine are:</p>

</table>

<p>Sodium bisulphite is a very efficient &#8220;antichlor,&#8221; only 1.46
parts being required to remove 1 part of chlorine, but owing
to its instability the action is uncertain. Sodium thiosulphate
is a comparatively stable cheap salt, containing 5
molecules of water of crystallization, Na<span class="denom">2</span>S<span class="denom">2</span>O<span
class="denom">3</span>&middot;5H<span class="denom">2</span>O but
7 parts are necessary to remove 1 part by weight of chlorine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Antichlors&#8221; are used as aqueous solutions and the
dosage controlled in the same manner as for bleach solutions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
The action is an instantaneous one and it is consequently
necessary that the germicidal action should be complete
before the &#8220;antichlor&#8221; is added.</p>

<p><a name="Sec6_11" id="Sec6_11"></a>Filters, containing solid materials capable of absorbing
free chlorine, have also been used for removing the excess
of the germicidal reagent. Iron borings and aluminium
were used experimentally by Thresh<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_11" id="Fnanchor6_11"></a><a
href="#Fn6_11">[11]</a></span> but the process was
not commercially developed. The &#8220;De Chlor&#8221; filter, in
which carbon is the active substance, has been installed at
several water works in England (Reading, Exeter, Aldershot)
with apparently successful results. The Reading experimental
installation, described by Walker,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor6_12" id="Fnanchor6_12"></a><a
href="#Fn6_12">[12]</a></span> consisted of a steel
drum, 8 feet 3 inches in width, the top and bottom being
domed. In the upper portion, 10 feet 9 inches in depth, provision
was made for thorough admixture of the bleach solution
and water and a subsequent storage of thirty minutes.
The lower section of the filter was divided into three compartments,
the first and last of which contained graded
silica; the middle compartment was filled with a layer (20
inches deep) of specially prepared granulated charcoal or
carbon.</p>

<p>The filter was operated under pressure and passed an
average of 192,000 Imp. gallons per day, the rate being
32,000 Imp. gallons per square yard per day.</p>

<p>Water from the pre-filters (polarite and sand) was treated
with bleach to give a concentration of 1 p.p.m. of available
chlorine and passed through the De Chlor filter. The average
bacteriological results obtained during the first six months
operation were as follows:</p>

before being removed to permit the erection of larger units
having a total capacity of one million Imp. gallons per day.</p>

<h3>LIQUID CHLORINE</h3>


<p><a name="Sec7_1" id="Sec7_1"></a>The use of liquefied chlorine for the disinfection of water
was first proposed by Lieutenant Nesfield<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_1" id="Fnanchor7_1"></a><a
href="#Fn7_1">[1]</a></span> of the Indian Medical
Service. He stated that: &#8220;It occurred to me that chlorine
gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could
be found for using it.... The next important question was
how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished
in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined
iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal,
and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on,
and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required.
The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the
water is absolutely safe, and has only to be rendered tasteless
by the addition of sodium sulphite made into a cake or
tablet.... The cylinders could, of course, be refilled. This
method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water
carts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first <i>practical</i> demonstration of the possibilities of
this method was made by Major Darnall<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_2" id="Fnanchor7_2"></a><a
href="#Fn7_2">[2]</a></span> of the Medical
Corps, United States Army, in 1910. Chlorine was taken
from steel cylinders and passed through automatic reducing
valves which provided a uniform flow of gas for the water
requiring treatment. A uniform flow of water was maintained
through the mixing pipe and so secured a uniform
dosage. This apparatus might be considered as the forerunner
of the various commercial types of machines that were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
developed later and which are being so extensively used at the
present time.</p>

<p>A working model, having a capacity of 500 gallons per
hour, was erected at Fort Myer, Va., and was operated on
water that had been treated with alum but had received no
further purification. Despite the presence of the flocculated
organic matter, satisfactory purification was obtained with
0.5 to 1.0 p.p.m. of available chlorine and no taste or odour
was imparted to the supply.</p>

<p>From the results obtained at Fort Myer, and Washington,
D.C., Darnall concluded that &#8220;In general, it may be said
that with an average unfiltered river water such as that of the
Potomac, about one-half of one part (by weight) of chlorine
gas per million of water will be required. For clear lake
waters three-tenths to four-tenths of a part per million will be
sufficient.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Board of Officers of the War Department examined
the results and reported (June, 1911) &#8220;That the apparatus
is as efficient as purification by ozone or hypochlorite and is
more reliable in operation than either.... That it could
be installed at a very low cost and that the cost of operation
would be very slight.&#8221;</p>

<p>In June, 1912, Ornstein experimented with chlorine gas,
obtained from the liquefied gas in cylinders, for sewage and
water disinfection but his method differed from Darnall&#8217;s
in first dissolving the gas in water and feeding the solution to
the liquid to be treated.</p>

<p>Kienle<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_3" id="Fnanchor7_3"></a><a
href="#Fn7_3">[3]</a></span> made experiments at Wilmington, Del., in November,
1912, and obtained a constant flow of gas by means
of high- and low-pressure valves; the gas was dissolved in
water in an absorption tower and afterwards fed to the water
to be treated.</p>

<p>Van Loan and Thomas of Philadelphia experimented
with liquid chlorine on a large scale at the Belmont Filter
Plant in September, 1912. The chlorine was fed into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
filtered water basin in the gaseous state and the quantity
was regulated by the loss in weight of the containers. The
dosage was approximately 0.14 p.p.m. (West<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn7_4">[4]</a></span>).</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_2" id="Sec7_2"></a>Jackson, of Brooklyn, made similar experiments about
the same time at the Ridgewood Reservoir, Brooklyn, and
his type of apparatus was shortly afterwards put on the market
as the Leavitt-Jackson Liquid Chlorine Machine. The
regulation of the flow in this machine was determined by
the loss in weight of the gas cylinder which was suspended
from a sensitive scale beam. By moving the counterbalancing
weight on the beam at a constant rate, a uniform flow
of gas was obtained, the area of the orifice being kept constant
by the equilibrium in the balance operating controlling valves
through a system of levers.</p>

<p>This type of apparatus was tried at several places but it
was found that the adjustment of the regulating mechanism
was too sensitive and produced considerable irregularities
in the flow of gas.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_3" id="Sec7_3"></a>The type used by Ornstein and Kienle were combined
and commercially developed by the Electric Bleaching Gas
Co. of New York.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7A" id="Fnanchor7A"></a><a
href="#Fn7A">[A]</a></span> In this combined type the gas was collected
from one or more cylinders by means of a manifold
which delivered it to the regulating mechanism at the pressure
indicated by a gauge attached to the inlet pipe. Beyond
this gauge were two pressure-regulating devices, the first
being used primarily to reduce the initial pressure to about
15 pounds per square inch, and the second for controlling the
pressure through a range sufficient to give the desired discharge
of gas. The gas from the second regulator passed
through an orifice in a plate at a pressure indicated by a
suitable gauge which was calibrated in terms of weight of
chlorine per unit of time. The gas, on leaving the regulating
apparatus, passed up an absorption tower of hard rubber,
where it met a descending stream of water. The solution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>was carried by suitable piping to the point of application.
This type was modified in some cases by the substitution
of a flow meter of the float type for the inferential pressure
meter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a name="Fn7A" id="Fn7A"></a><a href="#Fnanchor7A">[A]</a></span>
This type has recently been withdrawn from the market.</p>

Solution Feed, Type A" width="438" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Manual Control Chlorinator, Solution Feed, Type A.</p></div>

<p><a name="Sec7_4" id="Sec7_4"></a>Another type of apparatus, developed by Wallace and
Tiernan,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7B" id="Fnanchor7B"></a><a href="#Fn7B">[B]</a></span>
is shown in <a href="#Fig6">Figs. 6</a> and <a href="#Fig7">7</a>. The gas under the
pressure indicated by the tank pressure gauge (<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>)
passes into the pressure compensating chamber, which maintains
a constant drop in pressure across the chlorine control<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
valve, through the check valve, and into the solution jar
after measurement in the pulsating meter. The water
required for dissolving the chlorine enters the jar through
the feed line and check valve and the solution passes along
the feed line after being water sealed in a special chamber.
The meter is a volumetric displacement one and is regulated
by observing the number of pulsations per minute. Each
pulsation corresponds to 100 milligrams or 0.00022 pound
of chlorine; diagrams for converting pulsations per minute
into weight per twenty-four hours are usually provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with the apparatus. This type of meter is suitable for
quantities between 0.1 and 12 pounds per day and possesses
the distinct advantage of enabling the operator to see the
actual delivery of the gas.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a name="Fn7B" id="Fn7B"></a><a href="#Fnanchor7B">[B]</a></span>
Manufactured by Wallace and Tiernan Co. Inc. N. Y.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><img src="images/fig007.png" alt="Manual Control Chlorinator,

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Manual Control Chlorinator, Solution Feed, Type B.</p></div>

<p>The quantities of gas exceeding 12 pounds per day the
type shown in <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a> may be used. The gas from the
control valve passes through a visible glass orifice which is
connected with the manometer. This manometer, or chlorine
meter, contains carbon tetrachloride and is graduated
empirically in terms of weight of chlorine per unit of time.
A suitable gauge indicates the back pressure thrown by the
check valve and registers the same pressure as the tank
gauge when the flow of gas is stopped. The gas passes into
the glass cylinder where it is dissolved in water and passes
out by the feed pipe.</p>

<p>The most accurate range of the orifice type is from 1-6,
i.e. if the minimum graduation on the scale is 10, the maximum
is 60. If quantities less than the minimum graduation
are desired, a smaller orifice with its corresponding scale
can be substituted in a few minutes.</p>

<p>These types are manually controlled, but automatic control
types, to meet almost any condition, can be obtained
and are in use in many cities.</p>

<p>In some instances (dry-feed types) the chlorine gas is
not dissolved in water prior to addition to the water requiring
treatment but is carried to the point of application as a dry
gas and enters the water through a diffusion plate made of
carborundum sponge. The sponge becomes saturated with
water because of the capillary action of the carborundum
upon the water. The pressure of the chlorine in the feed
pipe forces the gas through the diffuser in the form of minute
bubbles which become saturated with moisture. On meeting
the water they immediately go into solution and no gas
escapes.</p>

<p>The operation of liquid chlorine machines is exceedingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
simple. After the cylinders have been connected, the cylinder
valves are opened and the joints tested for leakage by holding
a swab of absorbent cotton saturated with strong ammonia
under them; a leakage is indicated by the appearance of
white fumes of ammonium chloride. The control valve is
then slightly opened and the auxiliary cylinder valves partially
opened; whilst the pressure in the apparatus is slowly
increasing the remainder of the joints are tested and if found
to be tight, the cylinder valves are fully opened and the control
valve opened to the desired amount. In the solution feed
types the water required as solvent is turned on before the
control valve is opened. Once the apparatus is working,
no further attention is required, except for the regulation
of the dosage in the manual control types, until the cylinders
are replaced. When the stock of gas in the cylinders is
almost depleted the pressure falls but it is always preferable
to determine the stock by standing the cylinders on a platform
scale and weighing at regular intervals. This also
provides a check on the apparatus and can be utilised to
check the operators.</p>

<p>The accumulation of substances that impede the flow of
gas is usually slow and is indicated by a gradual increase
in the back pressure. The orifice is calibrated at 25 pounds
back pressure and any deviation from this figure will show a
discrepancy between the actual weight of chlorine evaporated
and the amount calculated from the scale reading.</p>

<p>Liquid chlorine is usually sent out by the manufacturers
in steel cylinders which contain about 1.1 cubic feet of liquid
or approximately 100 pounds (1 cu. ft. = 89.75 pounds).<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7C"
id="Fnanchor7C"></a><a href="#Fn7C">[C]</a></span></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a name="Fn7C" id="Fn7C"></a><a
href="#Fnanchor7C">[C]</a></span> An effort is now being made to standardise cylinders of 150 lbs. capacity.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_5" id="Sec7_5"></a>For small installations only one cylinder is necessary
but it is always preferable to connect more than one. When
the flow of gas is rapid the temperature of the liquid chlorine
falls and reduces the pressure. The effect of the fall in
temperature, due to the latent heat of evaporation, can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
partially overcome by using a larger number of cylinders;
in addition a source of external heat should be provided
that will maintain the temperature of the cylinders at a
minimum of 80&deg; F. This is a &#8220;sine qua non&#8221; for successful
operation. The effect of the temperature upon the pressure
in the cylinders is shown in <a href="#Diag7">Diagram VII</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag7" id="Diag7"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM VII<br />
CHLORINE GAS PRESSURES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES</p>
<img src="images/diag007.png" alt="Chlorine gas pressures at various temperatures" width="500" height="305" /></div>

<p>In practice it is found impossible to utilise all the gas
contained in the containers; when the cylinders are almost
empty the pressure necessary for the operation of the regulating
device cannot be obtained and full cylinders must be
attached. When sufficient heat is provided the weight of
chlorine in the cylinder can be reduced to 1 - 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds before
the tank pressure becomes too low.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_6" id="Sec7_6"></a>Liquid chlorine machines will operate, with ordinary
care, for long periods. The various parts are made of such
metals as experience has demonstrated to be best able to
resist the corrosive action of the dry gas and the apparatus is
designed to prevent the access of moisture which would otherwise
produce corrosion and impede the flow of gas. Stoppages
are sometimes caused by brown deposits derived from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
impurities in the liquid chlorine. These are primarily due to
variations in the graphite electrodes used in the electrolytic
process for the manufacture of chlorine from salt.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a><img src="images/fig008.jpg" alt="Dunwoodie

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Dunwoodie Chlorinating Plant Treating 400,000,000 Gallons Per Day<br />
for New York City.</p></div>

<p>To convey the dry gas from the apparatus to the point of
application, copper or iron pipes may be used; for aqueous
solutions, flexible rubber hose must be employed. Chlorine
water is exceedingly active, chemically, and rapidly attacks
all the common metals; ordinary galvanised iron pipe is
eroded in a few days and should never be used.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_7" id="Sec7_7"></a>Liquid chlorine, for water disinfection, possesses several
marked advantages over the ordinary bleach process.</p>

<p>(1) The sterilising agent is practically 100 per cent pure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the only impurities being traces of carbon dioxide and air,
and does not deteriorate on storage; it will, in fact, keep
almost indefinitely.</p>

<p>(2) Liquid chlorine practically eliminates all labour
costs because of the simplicity of the apparatus and the
concentrated form of the sterilising agent. The apparatus
is so compact that all the cylinders and regulating apparatus
required for delivering 200 pounds of gas per day can be
placed in an area of about 50 square feet and it can consequently
be almost invariably accommodated in locations
where the trifling amount of attention required can be obtained
without extra cost.</p>

<p>(3) The sludge problem, inseparable from bleach installations,
is eliminated.</p>

<p>(4) Regulation of the dosage is simpler and consequently
usually more accurate. The dosing apparatus in bleach
plants invariably tends to choke and demands regular attention
from intelligent operators; a similar tendency in liquid
chlorine machines is easily detected and electrical devices
can be installed to indicate automatically any changes in the
flow.</p>

<p>(5) The first cost is smaller. The cost of liquid chlorine
machines varies from $400, for the small manual control
types, to $1,200, for the automatic control types. The
capital outlay is mainly determined by the number of
machines and accessories required and not, within certain
limits, by the capacity. One machine will deliver up to 200
pounds of gas per day, an amount sufficient to treat 60,000,000
U. S. A. gallons (50,000,000 Imp. gals.) at 0.40 p.p.m. of
available chlorine. Unless duplicate machines are installed
for the higher rates, the first cost is inversely proportional,
though not directly so, to the volume of water treated. It
is in all cases less than the first cost of a bleach plant of
equal capacity, accuracy, and durability.</p>

<p>(6) Liquid chlorine installations usually tend to produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
less complaints as to tastes and odours. This is probably
due, not to any merit of the chlorine <i>per se</i>, but to a more
accurate regulation of the dosage and efficient distribution
of the chlorine in the treated water. The advantages ensuing
from thorough admixture had only become partially appreciated
before liquid chlorine machines were fully developed
and they have been more fully utilised in the design of these
later installations.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_8" id="Sec7_8"></a>Claims have also been made that liquid chlorine prevents
&#8220;aftergrowths&#8221; but no evidence can be adduced in support
of this statement. Aftergrowths have occurred at many
places where this process is employed and in this respect it
possesses no advantage over hypochlorite installations.</p>

<p>It is also claimed that one pound of liquid chlorine is more
efficient, as a germicide, than an equal weight of chlorine
in the form of bleach. Jackson<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_5"
id="Fnanchor7_5"></a><a href="#Fn7_5">[5]</a></span> has stated that 1 pound of
chlorine is equal to 9 pounds of bleach; Kienle (<a href="#Fn7_3"><i>loc. cit.</i></a>)
that it was equal to 8 pounds of bleach, whilst Huy claimed
to have obtained an efficiency ratio of 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;10 at Niagara Falls,
N. Y. The conditions of the experiment were not comparable
however, in the last mentioned ratio. Catlett, at Wilmington,
N. C. (West<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn7_4">[4]</a></span>) obtained a better bacterial reduction
with 1 pound of liquid chlorine than with 6 pounds of bleach.</p>

<p>The efficiency ratio of chlorine to bleach has been reported
upon by West.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn7_4">[4]</a></span> From 1910-1913 the mixed filter effluents
of the Torresdale plant at Philadelphia were treated with
bleach but in November, 1913 the liquid chlorine process was
substituted. On comparing the results obtained during the
same months of the two periods it was found that, in general,
1 pound of liquid chlorine gave a slightly higher percentage
purification than 6-7 pounds of bleach. Similar results were
obtained at the other Philadelphia plants. The figures
published by West show that the hypochlorite solutions
used were abnormally strong (3.6-10.4 per cent of available
chlorine), a condition that would increase the difficulty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
extracting all the soluble hypochlorite. It was found indeed,
that, under the most advantageous conditions, only 87 per
cent of the available chlorine was extracted. The average
chlorine content of the bleach used during 1912-1913 was
36.1 per cent but the figures given would indicate that at
least 1.5 per cent, a reduction of 4.6 per cent of the total, was
lost during storage. It would seem not improbable that
the total loss under average conditions was not less than 20
per cent, which would reduce the efficiency ratio to 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;4.8-5.6.</p>

<p>Hale<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_6"
id="Fnanchor7_6"></a><a href="#Fn7_6">[6]</a></span> also made a comparison of the relative efficiency
of liquid chlorine and hypochlorite of lime at New York,
and the earlier results agreed with West&#8217;s ratio of 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;6-7.
An investigation showed that large quantities of chlorine
were not extracted from the bleach and when this condition
was rectified the total loss averaged only 4 per cent and
the results obtained were equal to those given by the liquid
chlorine machines. Hale&#8217;s comparative figures are given in
<a href="#Tab23">Table XXIII</a>.</p>

<p>Hale concluded that, when efficiently used, the ratio of
chlorine to bleach required to produce equal bacterial purification,
approached 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>The results obtained by the author in Ottawa are similar
to those of Hale. During the earlier period of the bleach
treatment a dosage of 1.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine was
required to obtain satisfactory purification but various
improvements that were subsequently made enabled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
quantity to be reduced to 0.8 p.p.m. The same raw water
usually requires 0.75 to 0.80 p.p.m. of liquid chlorine to
obtain the same purification. The total losses in the Ottawa
bleach plant averaged 6-8 per cent and based on these figures
the efficiency ratio is approximately 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;3.5.</p>

<p>Ratios as low as 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;3.5 can only be obtained by the supervision
of a chemist and this analytical control involves additional
expense that must be charged against the bleach process.
No chemical analyses are necessary for the control
of liquid chlorine plants.</p>

<p><i>Disadvantages of Liquid Chlorine Plants.</i> The main objection
to the use of liquid chlorine is that the slight leaks of
gas occur occasionally and unless removed by forced ventilation
may produce a concentration of chlorine that will injure
the operators.</p>

<p>Pettenkofer and Lehmann<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_7"
id="Fnanchor7_7"></a><a href="#Fn7_7">[7]</a></span> found that 0.001-0.005
per cent of chlorine in air affected the respiratory organs;
0.04-0.06 per cent produced dangerous symptoms, whilst
concentrations exceeding 0.06 per cent rapidly proved fatal.</p>

<p>The danger of gas leakages can be eliminated by placing
the apparatus in a small separate room provided with a fan
and a ventilation duct. By the liberal use of glass in the
construction of the room, the operation of the plant can be
seen at all times without entering the chamber.</p>

<p>A portion of the liquid chlorine apparatus is made of
glass and is consequently easily fractured. Duplicates of
the glass parts should be kept in stock to prevent interrupting
the supply of gas; a duplicate machine is also advisable
in large installations.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_9" id="Sec7_9"></a><i>Cost of Treatment.</i> Prior to the outbreak of war in 1914,
liquid chlorine sold at 10-11 cents per pound in small quantities
and for 8-9 cents per pound in large shipments. In
1917 the price was 18-20 cents per pound for small quantities
and 15 cents upwards for large contracts. Canadian prices
are 25 per cent higher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>The amount of chlorine required for satisfactory disinfection
(see <a href="#Ch3">Chapter III</a>) depends upon the nature of the
water and the cost of treatment varies accordingly. In the
majority of plants the cost varies from 25-90 cents per million
gallons.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_10" id="Sec7_10"></a><i>Popularity of Process.</i> Since 1913, when the first commercial
liquid chlorine machines were used, the popularity of
this process has increased in a most remarkable manner.
In 1913 over 1,700 million gallons per day were treated with
hypochlorite; in 1915, 1,000 million gallons per day were
treated with liquid chlorine and an approximately equal
amount with hypochlorite; in January 1918, the amounts
were 3,500 million gallons per day (liquid chlorine) and 500
million gallons per day (hypochlorite).</p>

<p>This wonderful development has been largely due to the
intrinsic merits of the process and the reliability of the
machines manufactured although it has been indirectly
assisted by the excessive cost of hypochlorite during 1915-1916.</p>

<p>Liquid chlorine machines are being used for the purification
of water on the Western Front of the European battlefield.
The outfit is a mobile one and consists of a rapid sand
filter, liquid chlorine apparatus, a small storage tank and
solution tanks. Owing to the limited contact period available
a large dosage of chlorine is employed and the excess afterwards
removed by the addition of a solution of sodium thiosulphate.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_11" id="Sec7_11"></a><i>Chlorine Water.</i> Marshall<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_8" id="Fnanchor7_8"></a><a
href="#Fn7_8">[8]</a></span> has proposed the use of
chlorine water for the sterilisation of water for troops. The
solution is contained in ampoules which are of two sizes,
one for water carts and the other for water bottles of one
quart capacity.</p>

<p>The coefficient of solubility of chlorine, from 10&deg;-41&deg; C.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>is
<i>C</i> = 3.0361 - 0.04196<i>t</i> + 0.0001107<i>t</i><span class="enum">2</span>; when <i>t</i> = 10&deg; C. 1 c.cm.
of water absorbs 2.58 c.cms. of chlorine or 8.2 m.gr., a quantity
sufficient to give a concentration of 1 p.p.m. in 8 litres of
water. Marshall has stated that, when pure materials are
used, chlorine water is stable but the author is unable to
confirm this. A saturated solution of chlorine in distilled
water lost over 50 per cent of its available chlorine content
when stored for five days in the dark at 70&deg; F. The chlorine
present as hypochlorous acid increased slightly but
the quantity never exceeded very small proportions. Chlorine
solutions decompose in accordance with the equation,
Cl<span class="denom">2</span> + H<span class="denom">2</span>O = 2HCl + O.</p>

<p>Although chlorine water appears to be of little value
because of its instability there appears to be no reason why
chlorine hydrate should not be successfully employed. The
hydrate was first prepared by Faraday<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_9"
id="Fnanchor7_9"></a><a href="#Fn7_9">[9]</a></span> by passing chlorine
into water surrounded by a freezing mixture. A thick yellow
magma resulted from which the crystals of chlorine hydrate
were separated by pressing between filter paper at 0&deg; C.
The hydrate prepared by Faraday was found to have the
composition represented by the formula Cl&middot;5H<span class="denom">2</span>O but later
investigators have shown that more concentrated hydrates
can be prepared. Roozeboom<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_10"
id="Fnanchor7_10"></a><a href="#Fn7_10">[10]</a></span> prepared a hydrate represented
by the formula Cl&middot;4H<span class="denom">2</span>O and Forcrand<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor7_11" id="Fnanchor7_11"></a><a href="#Fn7_11">[11]</a></span> one containing
only 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span> molecules of water
(Cl<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;7H<span class="denom">2</span>O). Chlorine hydrate
separates into chlorine gas and chlorine water at 9.6&deg; C.
in open vessels and at 28.7&deg; C. in closed vessels. Pedler<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor7_12" id="Fnanchor7_12"></a><a href="#Fn7_12">[12]</a></span>
has shown that when the ratio of Cl<span class="denom">2</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;H<span class="denom">2</span>O is 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;64 or greater,
the mixture of chlorine hydrate and water exhibits great
stability and can be exposed to tropical sunlight for several
months without decomposition.</p>

<p>Cl<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;64H<span class="denom">2</span>O contains 5.8 per cent of chlorine and about
8. c.cms. would be required to give a concentration of 1 p.p.m.
in 110 Imp. gallons of water, the usual capacity of a military
water cart.</p>

<h3>ELECTROLYTIC HYPOCHLORITES AND CHLORINE</h3>


<p><a name="Sec8_1" id="Sec8_1"></a><a name="Sec8_2" id="Sec8_2"></a><a name="Sec8_3"
id="Sec8_3"></a>Since 1889 when Webster first proposed the use of electrolysed
sea-water as a disinfectant, various attempts have
been made to introduce electrolytic hypochlorites for the
bactericidal treatment of water and sewage. Two of these
preparations were named Hermite fluid, and electrozone
(c.f. <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>). Sodium hypochlorite, made by passing
chlorine into solutions of caustic soda, or by the decomposition
of bleach by sodium carbonate, has also been used
and preparations of this character have been sold under such
names as Eau de Javelle, Labarraque solution, chloros, and
chlorozone. These solutions contain mixtures of sodium
hypochlorite and sodium chloride together with some free
alkali. Chlorozone was the name given by Count Dienheim-Brochoki
to a number of preparations patented in 1876 and
subsequently down to 1885. They were produced by passing
air and chlorine into solutions of caustic soda. Lunge and
Landolt<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_1" id="Fnanchor8_1"></a><a
href="#Fn8_1">[1]</a></span> have shown that the air introduced is without
effect and that the advantages claimed for chlorozone are
illusory.</p>

<p>The earliest electrolytic installation on this continent was
operated at Brewster, N. Y., in 1893 and since that date
several plants have been erected where local conditions conduced
to economical operation.</p>

<p>When a uni-directional current of electricity is passed
through a solution of sodium chloride, the salt is dissociated
and the components liberated, NaCl = Na + Cl. If the elements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
are not separated, the chlorine combines with the
sodium hydrate, formed by the action of the sodium on the
water, to form sodium hypochlorite. The equations
2Na + 2H<span class="denom">2</span>O = 2NaOH + H<span class="denom">2</span>, and 2NaOH + Cl<span class="denom">2</span> = NaOCl + NaCl
+ H<span class="denom">2</span>O show that only one-half of the chlorine produced is
found as hypochlorite; the other half reforming sodium
chloride.</p>

<p>Several types of electrolysers have been used for the production
of hypochlorites and chlorine but only two are suitable
for water-works purposes: in one, the cathodic and anodic
products recombine in the main body of the electrolyte; in the
other, the diaphragm process, they are separated as removed
and the final products are chlorine gas and a solution containing
caustic soda and some undecomposed salt.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago the non-diaphragm process was the
only one used for water treatment and it will consequently
be discussed first.</p>

<p><a name="Sec8_4" id="Sec8_4"></a><i>Non-diaphragm Process.</i> The theoretical voltage required
for the decomposition of sodium chloride is 2.3 but when the
products recombine in the electrolyte, side reactions occur
which increase the minimum voltage to 3.54. On this basis
one kilowatt hour gives 272 ampere hours and as one ampere
hour is theoretically capable of producing 1.33 grams of
chlorine, 1.21 kilowatt hours are necessary for the production
of 1 pound of chlorine by the decomposition of 1.65
pounds of salt.</p>

<p>Charles Watt (1851) discovered this process and was the
first to recognize the necessary conditions which are (1)
insoluble electrodes, (2) low temperature of electrolyte, and
(3) rapid circulation of electrolyte from the cathode to the
anode. The control of the temperature is very important,
for as it increases, side reactions occur with the formation
of chlorates, and the efficiency is decreased.</p>

<p>The non-diaphragm cells used in Europe (Haas and Oettel,
Kellner, Hermite, Vogelsand, and Mather and Platt)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have been described by Kershaw.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_2" id="Fnanchor8_2"></a><a
href="#Fn8_2">[2]</a></span> In the Haas and Oettel
electrolyser the electrodes are composed of carbon but in the
other types at least one electrode is made from platinum or a
platinum alloy. The Dayton electrolyser, which is the cell
most familiar in North America, is shown in <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig9" id="Fig9"></a><img src="images/fig009.jpg" alt="Dayton Electrolytic Cell" width="500" height="399" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Dayton Electrolytic Cell.</p></div>

<p>The outer cell is made of soapstone and is approximately
2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span> feet long and 2 feet wide. The main electrodes consist
of four pieces of Atcheson graphite connected together by
screws and metal strips to which is attached a clamp for
connecting electrical terminals. Circulation of the brine is
produced by glass baffle plates and secondary electrodes
placed one inch apart between the main electrodes. The
cell is intended to be used at 110-volts pressure but by wiring
two cells in series a 220-volt circuit may be employed. An
inlet and outlet are provided at each end of the tank to permit
the direction of the flow to be periodically reversed for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
purpose of removing the lime deposit from the graphite
plates.</p>

<p>The salt solution is prepared in wooden tanks from coarse
clean salt (ground rock salt is unsuitable), containing as little
iron as possible, in the proportion of 50 pounds to 100 gallons
of water. After passing through a gravel or other suitable
filter the brine solution is carried by brass pipes to the electrolyser.
The rate of flow is adjusted to the temperature
of the hypochlorite solution leaving the cell but under normal
conditions it is stated that the cell described will pass 40
gallons per hour with a consumption of 70 amperes and produce
2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds of chlorine per hour. This is equal to 8
pounds of salt and 3.08 kilowatt hours per pound of chlorine.
After the cells have been operated for several months the
efficiency usually falls and 10-11 pounds of salt and 3.5-3.7
kilowatt hours are required for the production of one pound
of chlorine. The concentration of the hypochlorite solution
is usually about 6 grams per litre.</p>

<p>Rickard<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_3" id="Fnanchor8_3"></a><a
href="#Fn8_3">[3]</a></span> stated that by cooling the Dayton cell with ice
1 pound of chlorine could be produced from 2.65 kilowatt
hours and 6.9 pounds of sodium chloride; without cooling
the figures were 3.62 kilowatt hours and 7.2 pounds of salt.
Based on the figures that have been obtained from mature
cells, the efficiency of the Dayton cell as compared with those
described by Kershaw is as follows:</p>

<p>The electrical and chemical efficiencies of the Haas and
Oettel and Dayton cells, which contain carbon electrodes,
are smaller than those containing platinum electrodes but
for water sterilisation the carbon cells have been found to be
more suitable. To prevent the action of magnesium salts
on the platinum electrodes it is necessary to use a higher
grade of salt or to provide means of purification. Because
of the absence of a base and the presence of chlorides, electrolytic
hypochlorite cannot be stored for more than a few
hours without appreciable loss of titre. Unless used for the
treatment of the effluent of a filter plant operated at a fairly
constant rate a small storage tank is necessary to compensate
for the irregular demand and to provide the head required
by orifice feed boxes. Small variations can be made by regulating
the flow through the cells but large ones are not compatible
with efficiency, which is the highest under a constant
load.</p>

<p>Claims have been made that electrolytic hypochlorite
is more efficient as a germicide than bleach when compared
on the basis of their available chlorine content but no evidence
of it has been produced. Bleach contains an excess of base,
which retards the germicidal action, and electrolytic hypochlorite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
contains an excess of sodium chloride, which accelerates
it (Race<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_4" id="Fnanchor8_4"></a><a
href="#Fn8_4">[4]</a></span>) but the ultimate effect is the same with both.

<p>Electrolytic hypochlorite has a greater germicidal velocity
than bleach but the difference is so small as to be of no practical
importance. Rabs<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_5" id="Fnanchor8_5"></a><a href="#Fn8_5">[5]</a></span>
experimented with various hypochlorites
but was unable to find any appreciable differences
in their germicidal action.</p>

<p>If electrical power can be obtained at a very low cost,
or if the cost is merely nominal, as it is when there is an
appreciable difference between the normal consumption
and the peak load upon which the rate is based, the electrolytic
hypochlorite method offers some advantages but in
the great majority of plants it cannot economically compete
with bleach. The instability of the liquor and cell troubles
have also prevented the process being generally utilised.
Baltimore and Cincinnati experimented with this method
but did not adopt it. Winslow<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_6" id="Fnanchor8_6"></a><a
href="#Fn8_6">[6]</a></span> has reported that, owing to
the difficulty in obtaining bleach since the outbreak of war,
Petrograd has used electrolytic hypochlorite made from salt.</p>

<p><a name="Sec8_5" id="Sec8_5"></a><i>Diaphragm Process.</i> The various types of diaphragm
cells that have been commercially operated are of two varieties:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
(1) cells with submerged diaphragms and (2) cells in
which the electrolyte comes in contact with one face only
of an unsubmerged diaphragm.</p>

<p>The Le Sueur, Gibbs, Crocker, Billiter-Siemens, Nelson,
and Hargreaves-Bird cells are of the submerged diaphragm
variety. The Nelson cell has been operated for some time
at the filtration plant at Little Falls, N. J. The cells are fed
with brine solution previously purified by the addition of soda
ash and have given fairly successful results although the
cost of maintenance is comparatively high. Tolman<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_7"
id="Fnanchor8_7"></a><a href="#Fn8_7">[7]</a></span> has
reported that several towns in West Virginia use a bleach
solution prepared by absorbing chlorine, manufactured by
the Hargreaves-Bird process, in lime water; the solution
contains about 1.95 per cent of available chlorine.</p>

<p>The diaphragms in both the submerged and unsubmerged
types are usually constructed either with asbestos paper or
cloth, placed in such a manner as to divide the cells into two
separate compartments: the anodic, into which the brine is
fed and where the chlorine is produced; and the cathodic,
where caustic soda is formed.</p>

<p>By maintaining the liquor in the anodic compartment
at a higher elevation than in the cathodic one, the direction
of flow is towards the latter, but owing to osmosis and diffusion
the separation is not complete and a portion of the
caustic soda passes the diaphragm and produces hypochlorite
with a consequent loss of efficiency and rapid deterioration
of the anodes. With the exception of the Billiter-Siemens
cell, the submerged diaphragm cells operate at not more than
85 per cent efficiency and the cost of maintenance is usually
high.</p>

<p>In the non-submerged diaphragm types the invasion
of the anodic compartment by caustic is much reduced and
the efficiency and life increased.</p>

<p><a name="Sec8_6" id="Sec8_6"></a>An electrolyser of the non-submerged diaphragm type
is the Allen-Moore cell which has been adopted by the Montreal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Water and Power Co. This has been described by
Pitcher and Meadows.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor8_8" id="Fnanchor8_8"></a><a
href="#Fn8_8">[8]</a></span> The general lay-out of the installation
is shown in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>, and the essential features are: a
salt storage bin having a capacity of 40 tons; the brine saturating
and purifying apparatus; duplicate 15 horse-power
motor-generator sets; four chlorine cells; and the silver
ejectors and distributing lines for carrying the chlorine solution
to the point of application.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span>&mdash;Brine Saturating and Purifying Equipment.</p></div>

<p>The brine solution, which is prepared by passing water
through the saturators previously filled with salt, is delivered
to the two concrete reaction tanks where an amount of soda
ash and caustic liquor sufficient to combine with the calcium
and magnesium salts is added, and the mixture filtered
through sand and stored in the purified brine tanks. To
prevent the formation of hypochlorites by the interaction
of chlorine and alkali, the alkalinity of the liquor is determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and sufficient hydrochloric acid added to ensure an
acidity of 0.01 per cent. The acid brine is delivered at one
end of the four cells (<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>) each of which is 7 feet long and
20<span class="enum">3</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">8</span> inches wide and consumes 600 amperes at 3.3 volts.
The cell box is built of concrete and is provided with a perforated
wrought iron cathode box and graphite anode plates
which are separated by an unsubmerged asbestos paper
diaphragm.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Sections of Allen-Moore Cell.</p></div>

<p><a name="Sec8_7" id="Sec8_7"></a>Each cell has a capacity of 32 pounds of chlorine per
day and the gas flow is determined by measuring the volume
of caustic soda produced in a given period of time and calculating
the weight from the volume and concentration as
determined by titration with standard acid; each gram of
NaOH is equal to 0.88 gram of chlorine. The efficiency
of the cell is obtained by dividing the number of grams of
chlorine produced per hour by the product of the current
volume (in amperes) and the factor 1.33, the theoretical
production of chlorine for one ampere hour. The average
efficiency of the Montreal cells was found to be 93 per cent.
The installation comprises four cells, one being held in reserve,
and the annual cost of producing 90 pounds of chlorine per
day is given as $2,500. The details are:</p>

<p>cost per pound of chlorine = 7.6 cents.</p>

<p>The diaphragm cells, like the non-diaphragm ones, operate
most efficiently under a constant load; they are consequently
suitable for treating the effluent of filter plants.</p>

<p>Where very cheap electrical power can be obtained, the
cost per pound of available chlorine is less for the electrolytic
method just described than for liquid chlorine or chlorine
obtained from bleach; but this condition obtains in very few
places. Mr. J. A. Meadows has suggested to the author
that the cost could be reduced by converting the chlorine
gas into hypochlorite and then adding dilute ammonia as
in the chloramine process (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_115">page 115</a>). The caustic
liquor, usually run to waste from the cathodic compartment,
could be delivered into a feed box from which it would be
drawn off by the water injector used for dissolving the chlorine
gas.</p>

<h3>CHLORAMINE</h3>


<p><a name="Sec9_1" id="Sec9_1"></a>Chloramine (NH<span class="denom">2</span>Cl), a chemical compound in which
one of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia has been replaced
by chlorine, was discovered by Raschig<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn9_1">[1]</a></span> in 1907. Chloramine
was prepared by cooling dilute solutions of bleach
and ammonia and adding the latter to the former contained
in a flask surrounded by a freezing mixture. The proportions
were as the equivalent weights of anhydrous ammonia
and available chlorine (approximately two parts by weight
of chlorine to one part by weight of ammonia). After gas
evolution had ceased the mixture was saturated with zinc
chloride and the magma distilled under reduced pressure.
The distillate was a dilute solution of comparatively pure
chloramine.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_2" id="Sec9_2"></a>The first to notice the effect of ammonia on the germicidal
value of hypochlorites was S. Rideal<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor9_2"
id="Fnanchor9_2"></a><a href="#Fn9_2">[2]</a></span> who noted that
during the chlorination of sewage, the first rapid consumption
of chlorine was succeeded by a slower action which continued
for days in some instances, and was accompanied by
a germicidal action after free chlorine or hypochlorite had
disappeared. Rideal stated that: &#8220;It became evident that
chlorine, in supplement to its oxidising action, which had been
exhausted, was acting by substitution for hydrogen in ammonia
and organic compounds, yielding products more or
less germicidal.&#8221; On investigating the effect of ammonia
on hypochlorite it was found that the addition of an equivalent
of ammonia to electrolytic hypochlorite increased the carbolic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
acid coefficient of 2.18, for one per cent available chlorine,
to 6.36 (nearly three times the value). Further experimental
work showed that the increase was due to the formation of
chloramine.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_3" id="Sec9_3"></a>The author, in 1915, during a series of experiments on
the relative germicidal action of hypochlorites, attempted
to prepare the ammonium salt by double decomposition of
bleach and ammonium oxalate solutions.</p>

<p class="ind10">Ca(OCl)<span class="denom">2</span> + (NH<span class="denom">4</span>)<span
class="denom">2</span>C<span class="denom">2</span>O<span class="denom">4</span> = CaC<span
class="denom">2</span>O<span class="denom">4</span> + 2NH<span class="denom">4</span>OCl.</p>

<p>The velocity of the germicidal action of the solution was
found to be about ten times greater than the germicidal
velocities of other hypochlorites of equal concentrations,
(Race<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn9_3">[3]</a></span>), and from a consideration of the chemical formula
of ammonium hypochlorite it appeared probable that it would
be very unstable and decompose into chloramine, which
Rideal had previously shown to have an abnormal germicidal
action, and water. NH<span class="denom">4</span>OCl = NH<span class="denom">2</span>CL + H<span class="denom">2</span>O. After these
results have been confirmed, the effect of adding ammonia
to bleach solution was tried and it was found that 0.20 p.p.m.
of available chlorine and 0.10 p.p.m. of ammonia produced
equally good results as 0.60 p.p.m. of chlorine only. Similar
results were obtained on the addition of ammonia to electrolytic
hypochlorite.</p>

<p>Experiments made with a view to determining the most
efficient ratios of ammonia gave very surprising results:
chlorine to ammonia ratios (by weight) between 8&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 and
1&nbsp;:&nbsp;2 gave approximately the same germicidal velocity.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Fn9_3">[3]</a></span>
The action of the ammonia on the oxidising power of bleach,
as measured by the indigo test, was also found to be disproportionate
to the amount added.</p>

<p>The oxidising action of various mixtures of bleach and
ammonia as measured by the rate of absorption of the available
by the organic matter in the Ottawa River water is
shown in <a href="#Tab25">Table XXV</a>.</p>

<p>The 8&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio caused a marked reduction in the rate of
absorption of the chlorine whilst a 4&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio was almost as
active as the ratios containing more ammonia.</p>

<p>At the time when the abnormal results were obtained
with ammonium hypochlorite and mixtures of bleach and
ammonia, the phenomenon appeared to be of scientific interest
only and especially so as Rideal had attributed the obnoxious
tastes and odours, sometimes produced by chlorination,
to the formation of chloramines. During the winter of
1915-1916 the price of bleach, however, advanced to extraordinary
heights and the author then determined to try out
the process on a practical scale for the purification of water.
A subsidiary plant pumping about 200,000 Imperial gallons
per day (240,000 U. S. A. gallons) was found to be available
for this purpose and the chloramine process was substituted
for the bleach method previously in operation. The process
was commenced by the addition of pure ammonia fort, in
the amount required to give a chlorine to ammonia ratio of
2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1, to the bleach solutions in the barrels. The results
were not in accordance with those obtained in the laboratory
and it was found that the samples of bleach solutions received
for analysis were far below the strength calculated from the
amount of dry bleach used. This experience was repeated
on subsequent days and the deficiency was found to increase
on increasing the ammonia dosage. Solutions of similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
concentration were then used in the laboratory with similar
losses, and it was observed that on the addition of ammonia a
copious evolution of gas occurred. An investigation showed
that the ammonia and bleach must be mixed as dilute solutions
and prolonged contact avoided (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>). Alterations
were accordingly made in the plant and the bleach and
ammonia were prepared as dilute solutions in separate vessels
and allowed to mix for only a few seconds before delivery to
the suction of the pumps. This method of application was
instantaneously successful and results equal to those obtained
in the laboratory were at once secured. The dosage was
reduced until the bacteriological results were adversely
affected and continued at values slightly in excess of this
figure (0.15 p.p.m.) for a short period to prove that the
process was reliable.</p>

<p>From a consideration of the work of Raschig and
Rideal, it appeared that the most efficient proportions of
available chlorine and ammonia would be two parts by weight
of the former to one part of the latter and this ratio was
maintained during the run on the experimental plant. Lower
ratios of chlorine to ammonia were contra-indicated by the
laboratory experiments, which showed that the efficiency
was not increased thereby whilst higher ratios were left for
future consideration.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_4" id="Sec9_4"></a>The results obtained on the experimental plant, together
with those obtained on the main plant, where 24 million
gallons per day were treated with bleach only, are given in
<a href="#Tab26">Tables XXVI</a>, <a href="#Tab27">XXVII</a> and <a href="#Tab28">XXVIII</a>. The two periods given
represent the spring flood condition and that immediately
preceding it; these are respectively the worst and best water
periods. The results in both cases are from samples examined
approximately two hours after the application of the
chemicals.</p>

<p>The cost data were calculated on the current New York
prices of bleach and ammonia.</p>

the adoption of the process on the main chlorinating

1917.</p>

<p>In place of ammonia fort, aqua ammonia (26&deg; B&eacute;.), containing
approximately 29 per cent of anhydrous ammonia,
was used. The material was first examined by the presence
of such noxious substance as cyanides and found to be very

<p>The general design of the plant is shown in <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>.
The bleach is mixed in tank <i>A</i> as a solution containing 0.3
to 0.6 per cent of available chlorine and delivered to tanks
<i>B</i> and <i>D</i>, each of which has a twenty-four-hour storage capacity.
The ammonia solution is mixed and stored in tank <i>B</i>
and contains 0.3-0.5 per cent of anhydrous ammonia. The
two solutions are run off into boxes <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> which maintain
a constant head on valves <i>V</i> and <i>V&#8242;</i> controlling the head on
the orifices. Both orifices discharge into a common feed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
box <i>G</i> from which the mixture is carried by the water injector
<i>J</i> through one of duplicate feed pipes and discharged into
the suction well through a perforated pipe.</p>

<p>As tank <i>B</i> was previously used as a bleach storage tank,
the change from hypochlorite alone to chloramine necessitated
very little expense.</p>

<p>The treatment was commenced by gradually increasing
the quantity of ammonia, until a dosage of 0.12 p.p.m. was
reached, and constantly increasing the dosage of bleach,
which was formerly 0.93 p.p.m. of available chlorine. Owing
to the restrictions imposed by the Provincial authorities
it has not been possible to maintain a dosage as low as that
indicated as sufficient by the experimental plants results,
but some interesting data have been obtained. <a href="#Tab29">Table XXIX</a>
shows the results obtained from February to October, 1917,
from the chloramine treatment at Ottawa and also those
obtained with liquid chlorine at Hull where the same raw
water is treated with 0.7-0.8 p.p.m. of chlorine.</p>

80 p.p.m. of turbidity and over 500 <i>B. coli</i> per c.cm.
but 0.6 p.p.m. of chlorine and 0.13 p.p.m. of ammonia reduced
the <i>B. coli</i> index in the tap samples to 2.5 per 100 c.cms.;
samples taken in Hull on the same day (treated with 0.7-0.8
p.p.m. of liquid chlorine) gave a <i>B. coli</i> index of 26.7. Previous
experiences in Ottawa has shown that a dosage of approximately
1.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine is required to reduce
the <i>B. coli</i> index to 2.0 per 100 c.cms. under similar physical
and bacteriological conditions.</p>

<p>During the period of nine months covered by the results
in <a href="#Tab29">Table XXIX</a>, only five cases of typhoid fever were reported
in which the evidence did not clearly indicate that the infection
had occurred outside the city. The reduction in the
bleach consumed during the same period effected a saving of
$3,200.</p>

<p>During one period of operation the hypochlorite dosage
was gradually reduced to ascertain what factor of safety
was maintained with a dosage of 0.5 p.p.m. of available
chlorine and 0.06-0.08 p.p.m. of ammonia. The results are
shown in <a href="#Diag8">Diagram VIII</a>. The percentage of samples of treated
water showing <i>B. coli</i> in 50 c.cms. was calculated from the
results of the examination of 4-7 samples daily.</p>

<p>The results showed that it was possible to reduce the
chlorine dosage to 0.25 p.p.m. with 0.06 p.p.m. of ammonia
without adversely affecting the bacteriological purity of the
tap supply and fully confirmed the experimental results
previously obtained.</p>

<p>The chlorine to ammonia ratio is very important because
of its influence on the economics of the process (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag8" id="Diag8"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM VIII<br />CHLORAMINE TREATMENT, OTTAWA</p>
<img src="images/diag008.png" alt="Chloramine Treatment, Ottawa" width="652" height="500" /></div>

<p>All the laboratory and works results that have been
obtained in Ottawa indicate the importance of an adequate
contact period. The superiority of chloramine over other
processes is due to the non-absorption of the germicidal agent
and to obtain the same degree of efficiency the contact period
must be increased as the concentration is decreased. For
this reason the best results will be obtained by chlorinating
at the entrance to reservoirs or under other conditions that
will ensure several hours contact. At Ottawa the capacity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the pipes connecting the pumping station (point of chlorination)
and the distribution mains provides a contact period
of one and a quarter hours but even better results would be
obtained if the contact period were increased.</p>

<p>The general results obtained during the use of chloramine
at Ottawa in 1917 have shown that the aftergrowths noted
during the use of hypochlorite (see <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>) have been entirely
eliminated and that the <i>B. coli</i> content of the tap samples
from outlying districts has been invariably less than that of
samples taken from taps near to the point of application of
the chloramine. At Denver, Col., where the chloramine
process has also been used, similar results were obtained<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Fnanchor9_5" id="Fnanchor9_5"></a><a href="#Fn9_5">[5]</a></span>:
four days after the initiation of the chloramine treatment
the aftergrowth count on gelatine of the Capitol Hill reservoir
dropped from 15,000 to 10 per c.cm. The hypochlorite dosage
was cut from 0.26-0.13 p.p.m. of available chlorine and
0.065 p.p.m. of ammonia added.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_6" id="Sec9_6"></a><i>Economics of the Chloramine Process.</i> The chloramine
process was introduced at Ottawa for the purpose of obtaining
relief from the effect of the high price of bleach caused by the
cessation of imports from Europe in 1915. The results
obtained with the experimental plant indicated that, calculated
on the prices current at the beginning of 1917, appreciable
economies could be made. Although the reduction
in the chlorine dosage has not been as great as was anticipated,
due to the restrictions previously mentioned, the cost of
sterilising chemicals in 1917 was $3,200 less than the cost of
straight hypochlorite treatment.</p>

<p>During the latter part of 1917 the relative cost of bleach
and ammonia changed (see <a href="#Diag9">Diagram IX</a>).</p>

<p>When calculated on the New York prices for January,
1918, the cost of chloramine treatment in the United States
would be greater than hypochlorite alone unless a large
reduction in the dosage could be secured by very long contact
periods. This condition is only temporary, however, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the price of ammonia will probably gradually decline as the
plants for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen commence operations
and reduce the demand for the ammonia produced from
ammoniacal gas liquor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag9" id="Diag9"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM IX<br />
BLEACH AND AMMONIA PRICES</p>
<img src="images/diag009.png" alt="Bleach and ammonia prices" width="500" height="379" /></div>

<p>In Canada, the market conditions are still (1918) favourable
to the chloramine process: bleach is 25 per cent higher
than the U.S.A. product and ammonia can be obtained for
one-half the New York prices.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_7" id="Sec9_7"></a><i>Advantages of the Chloramine Process.</i> Although the
market conditions may, in some instances, be unfavourable
to the chloramine process, the method possesses certain
advantages that more than offset a slight possible increase
in the cost of materials. The taste and odour of chloramine
is even more pungent than that of chlorine but since the introduction
of the process in Ottawa no complaints have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
received. Owing to the reduced dosage, slight proportional
fluctuations in the dosage do not produce the same variations
in the amount of free chlorine which is the usual cause of
complaints. A public announcement that the amount of
hypochlorite has been reduced also has a psychological effect
upon the consumers and tends to reduce complaints due to
auto-suggestion.</p>

<p>The most important advantage of the process is the
elimination of the aftergrowth problem. At Denver, where
the aftergrowth trouble is possibly more acute than at any
other city on the continent, it was effectively banished by
the use of chloramine. At Ottawa, the sanitary significance
of <i>B. coli</i> aftergrowths is no longer of practical interest because
such aftergrowths have ceased to occur. Whatever may be
their opinion as to the sanitary significance of aftergrowths,
all water sanitarians will agree that the better policy is to
prevent their occurrence.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_8" id="Sec9_8"></a><i>Operation of Chloramine Process.</i> For the successful
operation of the chloramine process, the essential factors
are low concentrations of the hypochlorite and ammonia
solutions. The author has found that hypochlorite containing
0.3-0.5 per cent of available chlorine and ammonia containing
0.3-0.5 per cent of anhydrous ammonia can be mixed in a
4&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 or 8&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio without appreciable loss in titre. Solutions
of these concentrations mixed in 4&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 ratio lost only
2-3 per cent of available chlorine in fifteen minutes and less
than 10 per cent in five hours. The effect of mixing solutions
containing 4.35 per cent of available chlorine and 2.2 per
cent of ammonia is shown in <a href="#Tab30">Table XXX</a>.</p>

<p>When the excess of ammonia is large, as on the addition
of ammonia fort, the second reaction predominates and the
yield of nitrogen gas is almost quantitatively proportional
to the quantity of available chlorine present. As ammonium
chloride has no germicidal action, and hydrazine a carbolic
coefficient of only 0.24 (Rideal), the formation of these compounds
should be avoided.</p>

<p>The dosage of chloramine can be checked by titration
of the available chlorine (see <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>) immediately after treatment
or by the estimation of the increment in the total
ammonia (free and albuminoid). Routine determinations
of the latter made in Ottawa show that practically the whole
(90-95 per cent) of the added ammonia can be recovered by
distillation with alkaline permanganate and that 85-90 per
cent is in the &#8220;free&#8221; condition.</p>

could be predicated from its heat of formation, which is
8,230 calories. The other possible chloramines should be
even more active as the heat of formation of these compounds
are:</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_9" id="Sec9_9"></a>Dichloramine is unknown but nitrogen chloride has been
prepared and is a highly explosive yellow oil that decomposes
slowly when kept under water in the ice box. NCl<span class="denom">3</span> can be
easily prepared by passing chlorine gas into a solution of

<h4><span class="smcap">Halazone</span></h4>

<p>For the sterilisation of small individual quantities of water
such as are required by cavalry and other mobile troops
bleach and acid sulphate tablets have been usually employed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Such tablets have given fairly satisfactory results but certain
difficulties inherent to these chemicals have made it desirable
to seek other methods.</p>

<p>The subject was investigated by Dakin and Dunham,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor9_7"
id="Fnanchor9_7"></a><a href="#Fn9_7">[7]</a></span>
who first tried chloramine-T (sodium toluene-<i>p</i>-sulphochloramide).
It was found that heavily contaminated waters,
and particularly those containing much carbonates, required
a comparatively high concentration of the disinfectant: 40
parts per million of chloramine-T were necessary in some
cases and such an amount was distinctly unpalatable. By
adding tartaric acid or citric acid the effective concentration
could be reduced to 4 p.p.m. but the mixture could not be
made into a tablet without decomposition and a two-tablet
system was deemed undesirable.</p>

<p>Toluene sulphodichloramines were next tried. Excellent
bacteriological results were obtained but the manufacture of
tablets again presented difficulties. When the necessary
quantity of dichloramine was mixed with what were assumed
to be inert salts&mdash;sodium chloride for example&mdash;the normal
slow rate of decomposition was accelerated. The dichloramine,
in tablet form, was also found to be too insoluble to
effect prompt sterilisation.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_10" id="Sec9_10"></a>The most suitable substance found by Dakin and Dunham
was &#8220;halazone&#8221; or <i>p</i>-sulphodichloraminobenzoic acid
(Cl<span class="denom">2</span>N&middot;O<span class="denom">2</span>S&middot;C<span
class="denom">6</span>H<span class="denom">4</span>&middot;COOH). This compound is easily prepared
from cheap readily available materials and was found to
be effective and reasonably stable.</p>

<p>The starting point in the preparation of halazone is
<i>p</i>-toluenesulphonic chloride, a cheap waste product in the
manufacture of saccharine. By the action of ammonia,
<i>p</i>-toluene sulphonamide is produced and is subsequently
oxidised by bichromate and sulphuric acid to <i>p</i>-sulphonamidobenzoic
acid. This acid, on chlorination at low temperatures,
yields <i>p</i>-sulphondichloraminobenzoic acid (halazone). The
reactions may be expressed as follows:</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illo001.png" alt="Halazone formation" width="300" height="84" /></div>

<p>Halazone is a white crystalline solid, sparingly soluble
in water and chloroform, and insoluble in petroleum. It
readily dissolves in glacial acetic acid from which it crystallizes
in prisms (M.P. 213&deg; C.).</p>

<p>The purity of the compound can be ascertained by dissolving
in glacial acetic acid, adding potassium iodide, and
titrating with thiosulphate; 0.1 gram should require 14.8
to 14.9 c.cms. of N/10 sodium thiosulphate. Each chlorine
atom in halazone is equivalent to 1 molecule of hypochlorous
acid and the &#8220;available&#8221; chlorine content is consequently
52.5 per cent or double the actual chlorine content.</p>

<p class="ind10">&gt;SO<span class="denom">2</span>&middot;NCl<span class="denom">2</span> + 4HI&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;SO<span
class="denom">2</span>&middot;NH<span class="denom">2</span> + 2HCl + 2I<span class="denom">2</span>.</p>

<p>From the bacteriological results given by Dakin and
Dunham it would appear that 3 parts per million of halazone
(1.5 p.p.m. available chlorine) are sufficient to sterilise heavily
polluted waters in thirty minutes and that this concentration
can be relied upon to remove pathogenic organisms.</p>

<p>The formula recommended for the preparation of tablets
is halazone 4 per cent, sodium carbonate, 4 per cent (or dried
borax 8 per cent), and sodium chloride (pure) 92 per cent.</p>

<p>Halazone and halazone tablets, when tested in the author&#8217;s
laboratory on the coloured Ottawa River water seeded with
<i>B. coli</i>, have given rather inferior results. With 1 tablet per
quart, over six hours were required to reduce a <i>B. coli</i> content
of 100 per 10 c.cms. to less than 1 per 10 c.cms. Clear well
waters gave excellent results and large numbers of <i>B. coli</i>
were reduced to less than 1 per 10 c.cms. in less than thirty
minutes. McCrady<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor9B" id="Fnanchor9B"></a><a
href="#Fn9B">[B]</a></span> has also obtained excellent results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
with various strains of <i>B. coli</i> seeded into the colourless St.
Lawrence water.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch10" id="Ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>RESULTS OBTAINED</h3>


<p><a name="Sec10_1" id="Sec10_1"></a>The object of adding chlorine or chlorine compounds to
water is for the purpose of destroying any pathogenic organisms
that may be present. In a few instances some collateral
advantages are also obtained but, in general, no other object
is aimed at or secured.</p>

<p>Chlorination does not change the physical appearance of
water; it does not reduce or increase the turbidity nor does
it decrease the colour in an appreciable degree.</p>

<p>The chemical composition is also practically unaltered.
When bleach is used there is a proportionate increase in the
hardness but the amount is usually trifling and is without
significance. During 1916 when the Ottawa supply was
entirely treated with bleach at the rate of 2.7 parts per million
(0.92 p.p.m. of available chlorine) the average increase in
the total hardness as determined by the soap method was
2.5 parts per million.</p>

<p>When chlorine is added to prefiltered water, as an adjunct
to filtration, an increase in the number of gallons filtered per
run has been noted at some plants. This increase is not so
great with rapid as with slow sand filters but in some instances
it has led to appreciable economies.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_2" id="Sec10_2"></a>Walden and Powell<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_1" id="Fnanchor10_1"></a><a
href="#Fn10_1">[1]</a></span> of Baltimore, found that the addition
of a quantity of bleach equal to approximately 0.50
p.p.m. of available chlorine enabled the alum to be reduced
from 0.87 to 0.58 grain per gallon. The percentage of water
used in washing the filters was also reduced, from 4.1 per cent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to 2.9 per cent, whilst the filter runs were increased on the
average by one hour and ten minutes. The net saving in
coagulant alone amounted to 30 cents per million gallons.</p>

<p>Clark and De Gage<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_2" id="Fnanchor10_2"></a><a
href="#Fn10_2">[2]</a></span> found that the use of smaller amounts
of coagulant during the period of combined disinfection and
coagulation resulted in an increase of nearly 25 per cent in
the quantity of water passed through the filter between
washings, and also in a material reduction of the cost of
chemicals, which averaged $2.62 per million gallons for
combined disinfection and coagulation as against $4.86 for
coagulation alone. The water used in these experiments
was obtained from the Merrimac River at Lawrence.</p>

<p>The effect of hypochlorite on the reduction of alg&aelig; growths
on slow sand filters was first noticed by Houston during the
treatment of the Lincoln supply in 1905. Two open service
reservoirs were fed with treated water and were themselves
dosed from time to time. &#8220;Previous to 1905 they developed
seasonally most abundant growths, but during the hypochlorite
treatment it was noticed that they remained bright,
clear, and remarkably free from growths&#8221; (Houston<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_3" id="Fnanchor10_3"></a><a
href="#Fn10_3">[3]</a></span>).</p>

<p>Ellms,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_4" id="Fnanchor10_4"></a><a
href="#Fn10_4">[4]</a></span> of Cincinnati, has also noted the effect of hypochlorite
on alg&aelig;. When the bleach was added to the coagulated
water the destruction of the plankton was not as satisfactory
as had been anticipated and it was found that large
doses destroyed the coating of the sand particles and rendered
the filters less efficient. The use of bleach in the filtered
water basin was more successful and cleared it of troublesome
growths.</p>

<p>In 1916, during the treatment of the London Supply
with bleach (dosage 0.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine), Houston
made further observations on this point. The Thames water,
taken at Staines, had previously been stored for considerable
periods in reservoirs, but this necessitated lifting the water
by pumps which consumed large quantities of coal that were
urgently needed for national purposes. As a war measure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the storage was eliminated and the water treated with hypochlorite
at Staines and allowed to flow by gravitation to the
various works where the slow sand filters are situated. The
treatment resulted in a marked reduction in the growths of
alg&aelig;, the reduction in the area of filters cleaned in 1916
(June to September) as compared with 1915 being as follows:</p>

<p>A portion of this reduction can probably be attributed
to the elimination of storage.</p>

<p>Chlorination, by decreasing the load on filter beds, has
enabled the rate of filtration to be increased in some cases.
This increased capacity, which would otherwise have necessitated
additional filter units, has been obtained without any
further capital outlay. At Pittsburg (Johnson<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_5"
id="Fnanchor10_5"></a><a href="#Fn10_5">[5]</a></span>) the rate of
filtration, after cleaning, was increased 250,000 gallons each
hour until the normal rate was reached; restored beds were
maintained at a 250,000 gallon rate for one week. After the
introduction of chlorination it was found possible to increase
the rates more rapidly without adversely affecting the purity
of the mixed filter affluents.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_3" id="Sec10_3"></a><i>Hygienic Results.</i> Evidence as to the actual reduction
of the number of such pathogenic germs as <i>B. typhosus</i> in
water supplies by chlorination is most readily found in the
death rates from typhoid fever in cities that have no other
means of water purification. In some cases this evidence
is necessarily of a circumstantial nature; in others it is
definite and conclusive.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_4" id="Sec10_4"></a>Some of the earlier results of the effect of chlorination on
typhoid morbidity and mortality rates were compiled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

<p>The figures given in this table show the effect of chlorination
only; no other form of purification was used during
the periods given, except at Toronto where a portion of the
supply has been subjected to filtration.</p>

<p>It will be seen that since chlorination was adopted the
typhoid death rates have been reduced by approximately
50 per cent and that the averages for the period after treatment
are almost invariably less than 20 per 100,000, a figure
that a few years ago was regarded as satisfactory. The
average death rate for the last available year is 11 per 100,000,
a result that is even more satisfactory and exceeds the anticipations
of the most optimistic of sanitarians.</p>

<p>A portion of the reduction in the typhoid rates is no doubt
due to improvements in general sanitary conditions but the
reduction is much greater than can be accounted for in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
manner alone and in many cases there was a sharp decline
immediately following the commencement of chlorination.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_5" id="Sec10_5"></a>In a few instances there is evidence that chlorination
has reduced the typhoid rates of cities previously supplied
with filtered water. <a href="#Diag10">Diagram X</a>, drawn from data supplied
by Dr. West, of the Torresdale Filtration Plant, shows the
effect of disinfecting the filter effluents at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>During the years 1909-10-11, when practically the whole
of the city supply was filtered, the average typhoid death rate
was 18, but when the water was also chlorinated, in 1914-15-16,
the rate was only 7, a reduction of 61 per cent.</p>

<p>The figures in <a href="#Tab32">Table XXXII</a> show that the Torresdale

water and that chlorination was necessary.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Diag11">Diagram XI</a> the typhoid death rates of Columbus,
Ohio, and New Orleans are shown to exemplify conditions
that have not been improved by chlorination. The endemic
condition of typhoid in Columbus was brought to an abrupt
conclusion by the installation and operation of the softening
and filter plant in September, 1908, and no further reduction
followed the introduction of chlorination in December, 1909.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag11" id="Diag11"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM XI<br />TYPHOID IN COLUMBUS AND NEW ORLEANS</p>
<img src="images/diag011.png" alt="Typhoid in Columbus and New Orleans" width="500" height="450" /></div>

<p>In New Orleans the typhoid rate decreased on the inception
of the new water works system in 1909 and again after
the installation of the Carrollton filters in 1912. The product
of the filtration plants has always been above suspicion but
aftergrowths occasionally developed and the bacterial count
then exceeded the United States Treasury standard. To
overcome this difficulty, hypochlorite was used in 1915, but,
as was anticipated, it had no effect on the typhoid rate. The
high rate in New Orleans is largely due to outside cases received
for hospital treatment and to other circumstances beyond
the control of the water and sewerage department.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>In all the examples previously cited, the evidence as to
the effect of chlorination on typhoid mortality rates is circumstantial
but, taken as a whole, it is fairly conclusive.
In the examples to be considered next the evidence is more
direct.</p>

<p>One of the most conclusive experiments as to the beneficial
effect of chlorination is that reported by Young<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Fnanchor10_8" id="Fnanchor10_8"></a><a
href="#Fn10_8">[8]</a></span> of
Chicago. The water supply of Chicago was obtained from
Lake Michigan by means of intake pipes and pumped to
various parts of the city. The distribution system was
divided into four districts and, although there was a certain
amount of mixing along the borders, the water supplied to
each district was substantially separate. The rapid and
progressive decline in the typhoid rate of Chicago (from 19<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in 1900 to 10.8 in 1911) subsequent to the diversion of the city
sewage from the lake, led to the assumption that water-borne
typhoid had ceased to be of any moment. Early in 1912,
however, permission was secured to chlorinate the supply
of one district (No. 1) and the treatment was continued until
December when the solutions commenced to freeze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<a href="#Diag12">Diagram XII</a> shows the effect of the treatment on the autumnal
increase in District No. 1 as compared with the other three
districts. The autumnal increase was calculated from the
excess of typhoid incidence for July to November inclusive,
over that for February to June inclusive.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag12" id="Diag12"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM
XII<br />AUTUMNAL INCREASE IN TYPHOID, CHICAGO (Young)</p>
<img src="images/diag012.png" alt="Autumnal increase in typhoid, Chicago" width="377" height="500" /></div>

<p>These results demonstrate in a most striking manner the
beneficial effect of chlorination. The general conditions,
with the exception of the raw water supply, were approximately
the same in all four districts. <a href="#Diag13">Diagram XIII</a> shows
that the raw water supply of District No. 1 was slightly worse
than any of the others, 21.8 per cent of the samples from
District No. 1 containing <i>B. coli</i> in 1 c.cm. as compared with
21.0 per cent in the most polluted supply of the other districts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag13" id="Diag13"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM XIII<br />B. COLI IN CHICAGO RAW WATER (Young)</p>
<img src="images/diag013.png" alt="B. coli in Chicago raw water" width="500" height="301" /></div>

<p>The results obtained at Ottawa are also conclusive. Following
two epidemics of typhoid fever in 1911 and 1912,
caused by breaks in the intake pipe, hypochlorite treatment
was commenced and has been in continuous operation until
February, 1917, when chloramine treatment was substituted.
The dosage has been so regulated as to assure a high degree
of purity at all times in the water delivered to the mains
and as evidence of this it might be mentioned that the average<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<i>B. coli</i> index (calculated by Phelps&#8217; method) for the years
1916 and 1917 was only 0.27 per 100 c.cms. The typhoid
rates for the five years preceding the epidemic years and for
a similar subsequent period are given in <a href="#Diag14">Diagram XIV</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Diag14" id="Diag14"></a><p class="caption">DIAGRAM XIV<br />TYPHOID IN OTTAWA</p>
<img src="images/diag014.png" alt="Typhoid in Ottawa" width="500" height="423" /></div>

<p>The diagram shows that there has been a constant reduction
in the city typhoid rate since the last severe epidemic
with the exception of the year 1915. The high rate of that
year was caused by a localised epidemic started by polluted
well water and spread by flies from an unsewered area. This
outbreak was the cause of about seven deaths registered
during that year (population 100,000).</p>

<p>The objection might be raised that if the reduction of the
typhoid rate were due to the water treatment, the decline
should have been abrupt and not a gradual one. It is probable
that there has been practically no water-borne typhoid in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the city since chlorination was commenced but this fact is
masked by cases from other sources. During 1911 and 1912
over 3,500 cases of typhoid were reported, of which an appreciable
number would become carriers for various periods of
time. As these carriers decreased the number of cases
infected by them would also decrease and so account for a
gradually declining death rate.</p>

<p>It might be further objected that the reduced typhoid
rate is due to a general improvement in the sanitary conditions.
If the death rate from causes other than typhoid
can be regarded as a measure of the general sanitary conditions
it is obvious from the data in <a href="#Tab33">Table XXXIII</a> that the improvement
in the typhoid rate is immeasurably greater than can be
ascribed to that cause.</p>

<p>One further objection might be made: that the raw water
was not infected during 1913-17 or infected to a smaller
extent than during the previous period. Attempts to isolate
<i>B. typhosus</i> from the raw water have invariably been futile
but their presence in 1914 might be inferred from the fact
that during the latter part of the summer of that year an
epidemic of typhoid fever occurred at Aylmer, a village that
discharges its sewage into the Ottawa River about six miles
above the Ottawa intake. Hull, situated on the opposite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
bank of the river and having a population of 20,000, takes
its water supply from the same channel that supplies Ottawa
but at a point a few hundred feet further down stream. During
November and December, 1914, some 200 cases of typhoid
fever (incidence 1,000 per 100,000) occurred in Hull as compared
with 28 in Ottawa. As the Ottawa intake is situated
between the Hull intake and the outlet of the Aylmer sewer
it is incredible that the Ottawa raw water was not also infected.</p>

<p>In 1916 a liquid chlorine plant was installed in Hull,
but in 1917, owing to an accident, it was out of commission
for a short period and at least 100 cases of fever developed
during the following month. During the same period only
two cases were reported in Ottawa and of these one was
obviously contracted outside the city.</p>

<p>In view of the preceding facts it must be granted that the
improvement in the typhoid rate of Ottawa can be definitely
attributed to an improvement in the water supply caused by
chlorination.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_6" id="Sec10_6"></a>The efficacy of chlorination to prevent and check epidemics
of water-borne typhoid has never been doubted. Innumerable
instances could be cited in which the prompt treatment
of large public supplies has promptly checked outbreaks that
threatened to assume serious proportions and there is no
doubt that the extremely low typhoid morbidity rate on the
Western Front of the European battlefield is partially due to
the extensive and rigorous chlorination measures that have
been instigated. Prophylactic vaccination and the prompt
isolation of typhoid carriers have largely contributed to the
wonderful results obtained but due credit must also be given
to the systematic purification and treatment of water supplies.
Similar results have been obtained at training camps
in Canada and in other countries by effective treatment
with either liquid chlorine or hypochlorite.</p>

<p>Since the inception of water chlorination in America in
1908, the merit of the method has been very generally recognized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
throughout the Continent but was regarded with
scepticism in Europe, except as a temporary expedient, until
the results obtained by the military forces compelled more
general recognition. Before the war, chlorination of water
supplies in England was only practised in a few isolated and
relatively unimportant instances; in 1917, practically the
whole supply of London was chlorinated and at Worcester a
similar treatment has been recommended to enable the slow
sand filters to be operated at higher rates without reducing
the quality of the water supplied to the consumers.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_7" id="Sec10_7"></a><i>Use and Abuse of Chlorine.</i> Inasmuch as chlorination has
no beneficial effect on water except the reduction of the
bacterial content it should be used for this purpose only and
under such conditions as permit the operations to be under
full control at all times. The supplies that can be most
efficiently and safely treated are those that are relatively
constant in chemical composition and bacterial pollution.
Changes in volume can be dealt with by automatic apparatus
but sudden changes in organic and bacterial content require
a change of dosage that cannot be made by any mechanical
appliance. Long experience and accurate meteorological
records may in some cases enable those in charge of chlorination
plants to anticipate changes in the conditions of the
water supply, but it is always preferable to provide a positive
method of preventing sudden changes by using chlorination
merely as an adjunct to other processes of purification.
Unpurified waters that are objectionable on account of their
bacterial content only are very rare, as the cause that produces
the bacterial pollution usually produces other conditions
that are equally objectionable though not so dangerous
to health. Sudden storms in summer, or sudden thaws
in winter, usually cause large increments in turbidity accompanied
by soil washings that often carry appreciable quantities
of f&aelig;cal matter into surface water supplies. Lake
supplies often suffer in the same manner and sewage, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
during normal conditions is carried safely away from water
intakes, obtains access to the supply. If the dosage is maintained
at a level sufficiently high to meet these abnormal
conditions, complaints as to taste and odour would ensue,
and in general, such a practice is impossible. Some supplies
have been chlorinated successfully for years but the
principle of using chlorination as the first and last line of
defence cannot be recommended. Success can only be
obtained by eternal vigilance and the responsibility for results
is more than water works officials should be called upon to
assume.</p>

<p>Chlorination is an invaluable adjunct to other forms of
water purification and it is not improbable that, in the future,
filter plants will be designed to remove &aelig;sthetic objections
at the lowest possible cost and that chlorination will be
relied upon for bacterial reduction. Chlorination is the
simplest, most economical, and efficient process by which
the removal of bacteria can be accomplished and there is no
valid reason why it should not be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>The popularity of this process has suffered through the
efforts of over zealous enthusiasts who have been unable
either to recognize its limitations or to appreciate the fact
that a domestic water supply should be something more than
a palatable liquid that does not contain pathogenic organisms.
Every system of water purification has its limited sphere of
utility and chlorination is no exception to the rule.</p>

purified by recrystallization from alcohol, is dissolved in
1 litre of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>2. Copper sulphate solution. Dissolve 1.5 grams of copper
sulphate and 1 c.cm. of concentrated sulphuric acid in
distilled water and dilute the solution to 100 c.cms.</p>

<p>3. Potassium bichromate solution. Dissolve 0.025 gram
of potassium bichromate and 0.1 c.cm. of concentrated sulphuric
acid in distilled water and dilute the solution to
100 c.cms.</p>

<hr class="c05" />

100 c.cms. of the sample in a Nessler tube and allow the solution
to stand at least five minutes. Small amounts of free
chlorine give a yellow and larger amounts an orange colour.</p>

<p>For quantitative determination compare the colour with
that of standards in similar tubes prepared from the solutions
of copper sulphate and potassium bichromate. The amounts

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
